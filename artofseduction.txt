The Seductive Character page 1
The Siren page 5
A man is often secretly oppressed by the role he has to play—by always having to be responsible, in control, and rational. The Siren is the ultimate male fantasy figure because she offers a
total release from the limitations of his life. In her presence, which is always heightened and
sexually charged, the male feels transported to a realm of pure pleasure. In a world where
women are often too timid to project such an image, learn to take control of the male libido by
embodying his fantasy.

The Rake page 17
A woman never quite feels desired and appreciated enough. She wants attention, but a man is
too often distracted and unresponsive. The Rake is a great female fantasy-figure—when he desires a woman, brief though that moment may be, he will go to the ends of the earth for her.
He may be disloyal, dishonest, and amoral, but that only adds to his appeal. Stir a woman's
repressed longings by adapting the Rake's mix of danger and pleasure.

The Ideal Lover page 29
Most people have dreams in their youth that get shattered or worn down with age. They find
themselves disappointed by people, events, reality, which cannot match their youthful ideals.
Ideal Lovers thrive on people's broken dreams, which become lifelong fantasies. You long for romance? Adventure? Lofty spiritual communion? The Ideal Lover reflects your fantasy. He or
she is an artist in creating the illusion you require. In a world of disenchantment and baseness,
there is limitless seductive power in following the path of the Ideal Lover.

The Dandy page 41
Most of us feel trapped within the limited roles that the world expects us to play. We are instantly attracted to those who are more fluid than we are—those who create their own persona.
Dandies excite us because they cannot be categorized, and hint at a freedom we want for ourselves. They play with masculinity and femininity; they fashion their own physical image,
which is always startling. Use the power of the Dandy to create an ambiguous, alluring presence that stirs repressed desires.

The Natural page 53
Childhood is the golden paradise we are always consciously or unconsciously trying to re-create.
The Natural embodies the longed-for qualities of childhood—spontaneity, sincerity, unpretentiousness. In the presence of Naturals, we feel at ease, caught up in their playful spirit,
transported back to that golden age. Adopt the pose of the Natural to neutralize people's
defensivencss and infect them with helpless delight.

The Coquette page 67
The ability to delay satisfaction is the ultimate art of seduction—while waiting, the victim is
held in thrall. Coquettes are the grand masters of the game, orchestrating a back-and-forth
movement between hope and frustration. They bait with the promise of reward—the hope of
physical pleasure, happiness, fame by association, power—all of which, however, proves elusive; yet this only makes their targets pursue them the more. Imitate the alternating heat and
coolness of the Coquette and you will keep the seduced at your heels.

The Charmer page 79
Charm is seduction without sex. Charmers are consummate manipulators, masking their cleverness by creating a mood of pleasure and comfort. Their method is simple: They deflect attention from themselves and focus it on their target. They understand your spirit, feel your pain,
adapt to your moods. In the presence of a Charmer you feel better about yourself. Learn to cast
the Charmer's spell by aiming at people's primary weaknesses: vanity and self-esteem.

The Charismatic page 95
Charisma is a presence that excites us. It comes from an inner quality—self-confidence, sexual
energy, sense of purpose, contentment—that most people lack and want. This quality radiates
outward, permeating the gestures of Charismatics, making them seem extraordinary and superior. They learn to heighten their charisma with a piercing gaze, fiery oratory, an air of mystery. Create the charismatic illusion by radiating intensity while remaining detached.

The Star page 119
Daily life is harsh, and most of us constantly seek escape from it in fantasies and dreams. Stars
feed on this weakness; standing out from others through a distinctive and appealing style, they
make us want to watch them. At the same time, they are vague and ethereal, keeping their
distance, and letting us imagine more than is there. Their dreamlike quality works on our unconscious. Learn to become an object of fascination by projecting the glittering but elusive presence of the Star.

The Anti-Seducer page 131
Seducers draw you in by the focused, individualized attention they pay to you. Anti-seducers
are the opposite: insecure, self-absorbed, and unable to grasp the psychology of another person,
they literally repel Anti-Seducers have no self-awareness, and never realize when they are
pestering, imposing, talking too much. Root out anti-seductive qualities in yourself and recognize them in others—there is no pleasure or profit in dealing with the Anti-Seducer.

The Seducer's Victims—The Eighteen Types page 147

Part Two

The Seductive Process page 161

Phase One: Separation—Stirring Interest and Desire

1 Choose the Right Victim page 167
Everything depends on the target of your seduction. Study your prey thoroughly, and choose
only those who will prove susceptible to your charms. The right victims are those for whom you
can fill a void, who see in you something exotic. They are often isolated or unhappy, or can
easily be made so—for the completely contented person is almost impossible to seduce. The
perfect victim has some quality that inspires strong emotions in you, making your seductive
maneuvers seem more natural and dynamic. The perfect victim allows for the perfect chase.

2 Create a False Sense of Security—Approach Indirectly page 177
If you are too direct early on, you risk stirring up a resistance that will never be lowered. At
first there must be nothing of the seducer in your manner. The seduction should begin at an
angle, indirectly, so that the target only gradually becomes aware of you. Haunt the periphery
of your target's life—approach through a third party, or seem to cultivate a relatively neutral relationship, moving gradually from friend to lover. Lull the target into feeling secure, then strike.

3 Send Mixed Signals page 185
Once people are aware of your presence, and perhaps vaguely intrigued, you need to stir their
interest before it settles on someone else. Most of us are much too obvious—instead, be hard to
figure out. Send mixed signals: both tough and tender, both spiritual and earthly, both innocent and cunning. A mix of qualities suggests depth, which fascinates even as it confuses. An
elusive, enigmatic aura will make people want to know more, drawing them into your circle.
Create such a power by hinting at something contradictory within you.

4 Appear to Be an Object of Desire—Create Triangles page 195
Few are drawn to the person whom others avoid or neglect; people gather around those who
have already attracted interest. To draw your victims closer and make them hungry to possess
you, you must create an aura of desirability—of being wanted and courted by many. It will
become a point of vanity for them to be the preferred object of your attention, to win you away
from a crowd of admirers. Build a reputation that precedes you: If many have succumbed to
your charms, there must be a reason.

5 Create a Need—Stir Anxiety and Discontent page 203
A perfectly satisfied person cannot be seduced. Tension and disharmony must be instilled in
your targets minds. Stir within them feelings of discontent, an unhappiness with their circumstances and with themselves. The feelings of inadequacy that you create will give you space to
insinuate yourself, to make them see you as the answer to their problems. Pain and anxiety are
the proper precursors to pleasure. Learn to manufacture the need that you can fill.

6 Master the Art of Insinuation page 211
Making your targets feel dissatisfied and in need of your attention is essential, but if you are
too obvious, they will see through you and grow defensive. There is no known defense, however, against insinuation—the art of planting ideas in people's minds by dropping elusive hints
that take root days later, even appearing to them as their own idea. Create a sublanguage—
bold statements followed by retraction and apology, ambiguous comments, banal talk combined
with alluring glances—that enters the target's unconscious to convey your real meaning. Make
everything suggestive.

7 Enter Their Spirit page 219
Most people are locked in their own worlds, making them stubborn and hard to persuade. The
way to lure them out of their shell and set up your seduction is to enter their spirit. Play by
their rules, enjoy what they enjoy, adapt yourself to their moods. In doing so you will stroke
their deep-rooted narcissism and lower their defenses. Indulge your targets' every mood and
whim, giving them nothing to react against or resist.

8 Create Temptation page 229
Lure the target deep into your seduction by creating the proper temptation: a glimpse of the
pleasures to come. As the serpent tempted Eve with the promise of forbidden knowledge, you
must awaken a desire in your targets that they cannot control. Find that weakness of theirs,
that fantasy that has yet to be realized, and hint that you can lead them toward it. The key is
to keep it vague. Stimulate a curiosity stronger than the doubts and anxieties that go with it,
and they will follow you.

Phase Two: Lead Astray—Creating Pleasure and Confusion

9 Keep Them in Suspense—What Comes Next? page 241
The moment people feel they know what to expect from you, your spell on them is broken.
More: You have ceded them power. The only way to lead the seduced along and keep the upper hand is to create suspense, a calculated surprise. Doing something they do not expect from
you will give them a delightful sense of spontaneity—they will not be able to foresee what
comes next. You are always one step ahead and in control. Give the victim a thrill with a sudden change of direction.

Contents

10 Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion page 251
It is hard to make people listen; they are consumed with their own thoughts and desires, and
have little time for yours. The trick to making them listen is to say what they want to hear, to
fill their ears with whatever is pleasant to them. This is the essence of seductive language. Inflame people's emotions with loaded phrases, flatter them, comfort their insecurities, envelop
them in sweet words and promises, and not only will they listen to you, they will lose their
will to resist you.

11 Pay Attention to Detail page 265
Lofty words of love and grand gestures can be suspicious: Why are you trying so hard to
please? The details of a seduction—the subtle gestures, the offhand things you do—are often
more charming and revealing. You must learn to distract your victims with a myriad of pleasant little rituals—thoughtful gifts tailored just for them, clothes and adornments designed to
please them, gestures that show the time and attention you are paying them. Mesmerized by
what they see, they will not notice what you are really up to.

12 Poeticize Your Presence page 277
Important things happen when your targets are alone: The slightest feeling of relief that you
are not there, and it is all over. Familiarity and overexposure will cause this reaction. Remain
elusive, then. Intrigue your targets by alternating an exciting presence with a cool distance,
exuberant moments followed by calculated absences. Associate yourself with poetic images and
objects, so that when they think of you, they begin to see you through an idealized halo. The
more you figure in their minds, the more they will envelop you in seductive fantasies.

13 Disarm Through Strategic Weakness and Vulnerability page 285
Too much maneuvering on your part may raise suspicion. The best way to cover your tracks is
to make the other person feel superior and stronger. If you seem to be weak, vulnerable, enthralled by the other person, and unable to control yourself you will make your actions look
more natural, less calculated. Physical weakness—tears, bashfulness, paleness—will help create the effect. Play the victim, then transform your target's sympathy into love.

14 Confuse Desire and Reality—The Perfect Illusion page 295
To compensate for the difficulties in their lives, people spend a lot of their time daydreaming,
imagining a future full of adventure, success, and romance. If you can create the illusion that
through you they can live out their dreams, you will have them at your mercy. Aim at secret
wishes that have been thwarted or repressed, stirring up uncontrollable emotions, clouding their
powers of reason. Lead the seduced to a point of confusion in which they can no longer tell the
difference between illusion and reality.

15 Isolate the Victim page 309
An isolated person is weak. By slowly isolating your victims, you make them more vulnerable
to your influence. Take them away from their normal milieu, friends, family, home. Give them
the sense of being marginalized, in limbo—they are leaving one world behind and entering
another. Once isolated like this, they have no outside support, and in their confusion they are
easily led astray. Lure the seduced into your lair, where nothing is familiar.

Phase Three: The

Precipice—Deepening

the Effect Through Extreme Measures

16 Prove Yourself page 321
Most people want to be seduced. If they resist your efforts, it is probably because you ham' not
gone far enough to allay their doubts—about your motives, the depth of your feelings, and so
on. One well-timed action that shows how far you are willing to go to win them over will dispel their doubts. Do not worry about looking foolish or making a mistake—any kind of deed
that is self-sacrificing and for your targets' sake will so overwhelm their emotions, they won't
notice anything else.

17 Effect a Regression page 333
People who have experienced a certain kind of pleasure in the past will try to repeat or relive
it. The deepest-rooted and most pleasurable memories are usually those from earliest childhood, and are often unconsciously associated with a parental figure. Bring your targets back to
that point by placing yourself in the oedipal triangle and positioning them as the needy child.
Unaware of the cause of their emotional response, they will fall in love with you.

18 Stir Up the Transgressive and Taboo page 349
There are always social limits on what one can do. Some of these, the most elemental taboos,
go back centuries; others are more superficial, simply defining polite and acceptable behavior.
Making your targets feel that you are leading them past either kind of limit is immensely seductive. People yearn to explore their dark side. Once the desire to transgress draws your targets to you, it will be hard for them to stop. Take them farther than they imagined—the
shared feeling of guilt and complicity will create a powerful bond.

19 Use Spiritual Lures page 359
Everyone has doubts and insecurities—about their body, their self-worth, their sexuality. If
your seduction appeals exclusively to the physical, you will stir up these doubts and make your
targets self-conscious. Instead, lure them out of their insecurities by making them focus on
something sublime and spiritual: a religious experience, a lofty work of art, the occult. Lost in
a spiritual mist, the target will feel light and uninhibited. Deepen the effect of your seduction
by making its sexual culmination seem like the spiritual union of two souls.

20 Mix Pleasure with Pain page 369
The greatest mistake in seduction is being too nice. At first, perhaps, your kindness is charming, but it soon grows monotonous; you are trying too hard to please, and seem insecure. Instead of overwhelming your targets with niceness, try inflicting some pain. Make them feel
guilty and insecure. Instigate a breakup—now a rapprochement, a return to your earlier kindness, will turn them weak at the knees. The lower the lows you create, the greater the highs.
To heighten the erotic charge, create the excitement of fear.

Contents
Phase Four: Moving In for the Kill

21 Give Them Space to Fall—The Pursuer Is Pursued page 383
If your targets become too used to you as the aggressor, they will give less of their own energy,
and the tension will slacken. You need to wake them up, turn the tables. Once they are under
your spell, take a step bach and they will start to come after you. Hint that you are growing
bored. Seem interested in someone else. Soon they will want to possess you physically, and restraint will go out the window. Create the illusion that the seducer is being seduced.

22 Use Physical Lures page 393
Targets with active minds are dangerous: If they see through your manipulations, they may
suddenly develop doubts. Put their minds gently to rest, and waken their dormant senses, by
combining a nondefensive attitude with a charged sexual presence. While your cool, nonchalant air is lowering their inhibitions, your glances, voice, and bearing—oozing sex and
desire—are getting under their skin and raising their temperature. Never force the physical;
instead infect your targets with heat, lure them into lust. Morality, judgment, and concern for
the future will all melt away.

23 Master the Art of the Bold Move page 405
A moment has arrived: Your victim clearly desires you, but is not ready to admit it openly, let
alone act on it. This is the time to throw aside chivalry, kindness, and coquetry and to overwhelm with a bold move. Don't give the victim time to consider the consequences. Showing
hesitation or awkwardness means you are thinking of yourself as opposed to being overwhelmed by the victim's charms. One person must go on the offensive, and it is you.

24 Beware the Aftereffects page 415
Danger follows in the aftermath of a successful seduction. After emotions have reached a pitch,
they often swing in the opposite direction—toward lassitude, distrust, disappointment. If you
are to part, make the sacrifice swift and sudden. If you are to stay in a relationship, beware a
flagging of energy, a creeping familiarity that will spoil the fantasy. A second seduction is required. Never let the other person take you for granted—use absence, create pain and conflict,
to keep the seduced on tenterhooks.

Thousands of years ago, power was mostly gained through physical violence and maintained with brute strength. There was little need for
subtlety—a king or emperor had to be merciless. Only a select few had
power, but no one suffered under this scheme of things more than women.

sophisticated art, the ultimate form of power and persuasion. They learned
to work on the mind first, stimulating fantasies, keeping a man wanting
more, creating patterns of hope and despair—the essence of seduction.
Their power was not physical but psychological, not forceful but indirect
and cunning. These first great seductresses were like military generals planning the destruction of an enemy, and indeed early accounts of seduction
often compare it to battle, the feminine version of warfare. For Cleopatra,
it was a means of consolidating an empire. In seduction, the woman was no
longer a passive sex object; she had become an active agent, a figure of
power.
With a few exceptions—the Latin poet Ovid, the medieval
troubadours—men did not much concern themselves with such a frivolous
art as seduction. Then, in the seventeenth century came a great change:
men grew interested in seduction as a way to overcome a young woman's
resistance to sex. History's first great male seducers—the Duke de Lauzun,
the different Spaniards who inspired the Don Juan legend—began to adopt
the methods traditionally employed by women. They learned to dazzle

imagination, to play the coquette. They also added a new, masculine ele— C H O D E R L O S DE LACLOS, ON

• The deliberate spellbinding of man's senses
was to have a magical effect
upon him, opening up an
infinitely wider range of
sensation and spurring him
on as if impelled by an
inspired dream.

People are constantly trying to influence us, to tell us what to do, and just
as often we tune them out, resisting their attempts at persuasion. There is a
moment in our lives, however, when we all act differently—when we are in
love. We fall under a kind of spell. Our minds are usually preoccupied with
our own concerns; now they become filled with thoughts of the loved one.
We grow emotional, lose the ability to think straight, act in foolish ways
that we would never do otherwise. If this goes on long enough something
inside us gives way: we surrender to the will of the loved one, and to our
desire to possess them.
Seducers are people who understand the tremendous power contained
in such moments of surrender. They analyze what happens when people
are in love, study the psychological components of the process—what spurs
the imagination, what casts a spell. By instinct and through practice they
master the art of making people fall in love. As the first seductresses knew,
it is much more effective to create love than lust. A person in love is emotional, pliable, and easily misled. (The origin of the word "seduction" is the
Latin for "to lead astray") A person in lust is harder to control and, once
satisfied, may easily leave you. Seducers take their time, create enchantment
and the bonds of love, so that when sex ensues it only further enslaves
the victim. Creating love and enchantment becomes the model for all
seductions—sexual, social, political. A person in love will surrender.
It is pointless to try to argue against such power, to imagine that you are
not interested in it, or that it is evil and ugly. The harder you try to resist
the lure of seduction—as an idea, as a form of power—the more you will
find yourself fascinated. The reason is simple: most of us have known the
power of having someone fall in love with us. Our actions, gestures, the
things we say, all have positive effects on this person; we may not completely understand what we have done right, but this feeling of power is intoxicating. It gives us confidence, which makes us more seductive. We may
also experience this in a social or work setting—one day we are in an elevated mood and people seem more responsive, more charmed by us. These
moments of power are fleeting, but they resonate in the memory with —ALEXANDER VON GLEICHENgreat intensity. We want them back. Nobody likes to feel awkward or timid RUSSWURM, THE WORLD'S

hysterical reaction, revealing your deep-down fascination with the process;
you are only making your desires stronger. Some day they will come to the
surface.
To have such power does not require a total transformation in your
character or any kind of physical improvement in your looks. Seduction is a
game of psychology, not beauty, and it is within the grasp of any person to
become a master at the game. All that is required is that you look at the
world differently, through the eyes of a seducer.
A seducer does not turn the power off and on—every social and personal interaction is seen as a potential seduction. There is never a moment
to waste. This is so for several reasons. The power seducers have over a man
or woman works in social environments because they have learned how to
tone down the sexual element without getting rid of it. We may think we
see through them, but they are so pleasant to be around anyway that it does
not matter. Trying to divide your life into moments in which you seduce
and others in which you hold back will only confuse and constrain you.

in the bedroom. (In fact, the seducer sees the world as his or her bedroom.)
This attitude creates great seductive momentum, and with each seduction
you gain experience and practice. One social or sexual seduction makes the
next one easier, your confidence growing and making you more alluring.
People are drawn to you in greater numbers as the seducer's aura descends
upon you.
Seducers have a warrior's outlook on life. They see each person as a
kind of walled castle to which they are laying siege. Seduction is a process
of penetration: initially penetrating the target's mind, their first point of
defense. Once seducers have penetrated the mind, making the target fantasize about them, it is easy to lower resistance and create physical surrender.
Seducers do not improvise; they do not leave this process to chance. Like
any good general, they plan and strategize, aiming at the target's particular
weaknesses.
The main obstacle to becoming a seducer is this foolish prejudice we
have of seeing love and romance as some kind of sacred, magical realm
where things just fall into place, if they are meant to. This might seem romantic and quaint, but it is really just a cover for our laziness. What will seduce a person is the effort we expend on their behalf, showing how much
we care, how much they are worth. Leaving things to chance is a recipe for
disaster, and reveals that we do not take love and romance very seriously. It
was the effort Casanova expended, the artfulness he applied to each affair
that made him so devilishly seductive. Falling in love is a matter not of
magic but of psychology. Once you understand your target's psychology,
and strategize to suit it, you will be better able to cast a "magical" spell. A
seducer sees love not as sacred but as warfare, where all is fair.

inward. When they meet someone their first move is to get inside that per-

on the other hand, can be anyone and can assume many roles. (The archetype here is the god Zeus, insatiable seducer of young maidens, whose
main weapon was the ability to assume the form of whatever person or animal would most appeal to his victim.) Seducers take pleasure in performing
and are not weighed down by their identity, or by some need to be themselves, or to be natural. This freedom of theirs, this fluidity in body and
spirit, is what makes them attractive. What people lack in life is not more
reality but illusion, fantasy, play. The clothes that seducers wear, the places
they take you to, their words and actions, are slightly heightened—not
overly theatrical but with a delightful edge of unreality, as if the two of you
were living out a piece of fiction or were characters in a film. Seduction is
a kind of theater in real life, the meeting of illusion and reality.
Finally, seducers are completely amoral in their approach to life. It is all
a game, an arena for play. Knowing that the moralists, the crabbed repressed
types who croak about the evils of the seducer, secretly envy their power,
they do not concern themselves with other people's opinions. They do not
deal in moral judgments—nothing could be less seductive. Everything is

would not find so many willing victims. Get rid of any moralizing tendencies, adopt the seducer's playful philosophy, and you will find the rest of the
process easy and natural.

The Art of Seduction is designed to arm you with weapons of persuasion and
charm, so that those around you will slowly lose their ability to resist with— O V I D , THE ART OF LOVE, out knowing how or why it has happened. It is an art of war for delicate

times.
Every seduction has two elements that you must analyze and understand: first, yourself and what is seductive about you; and second, your target and the actions that will penetrate their defenses and create surrender.
The two sides are equally important. If you strategize without paying attention to the parts of your character that draw people to you, you will be
seen as a mechanical seducer, slimy and manipulative. If you rely on your
seductive personality without paying attention to the other person, you will
make terrible mistakes and limit your potential.
Consequently, The Art of Seduction is divided into two parts. The first
half, "The Seductive Character," describes the nine types of seducer, plus
the Anti-Seducer. Studying these types will make you aware of what is
inherently seductive in your character, the basic building block of any seduction. The second half, "The Seductive Process," includes the twentyfour maneuvers and strategies that will instruct you on how to create a
spell, break down people's resistance, give movement and force to your
seduction, and induce surrender in your target. As a kind of bridge between the two parts, there is a chapter on the eighteen types of victims of a
seduction—each of them missing something from their lives, each cradling
an emptiness you can fill. Knowing what type you are dealing with will
help you put into practice the ideas in both sections. Ignore any part of this
book and you will be an incomplete seducer.
The ideas and strategies in The Art of Seduction are based on the writings
and historical accounts of the most successful seducers in history. The
sources include the seducers' own memoirs (by Casanova, Errol Flynn, Natalie Barney, Marilyn Monroe); biographies (of Cleopatra, Josephine Bonaparte, John F. Kennedy, Duke Ellington); handbooks on the subject (most
notably Ovid's Art of Love); and fictional accounts of seductions (Choderlos
de Laclos's Dangerous Liaisons, Søren Kierkegaard's The Seducer's Diary,
Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji). The heroes and heroines of these literary works are generally modeled on real-life seducers. The strategies they
employ reveal the intimate connection between fiction and seduction, creating illusion and leading a person along. In putting the book's lessons into
practice, you will be following in the path of the greatest masters of the art.
Finally, the spirit that will make you a consummate seducer is the spirit
in which you should read this book. The French writer Denis Diderot
once wrote, "I give my mind the liberty to follow the first wise or foolish

are my strumpets." He meant that he let himself be seduced by ideas, following whichever one caught his fancy until a better one came along, his
thoughts infused with a kind of sexual excitement. Once you enter these
pages, do as Diderot advised: let yourself be lured by the stories and ideas,
your mind open and your thoughts fluid. Slowly you will find yourself absorbing the poison through the skin and you will begin to see everything as
a seduction, including the way you think and how you look at the world.

e all have the power of attraction—the ability to draw people in and
hold them in our thrall. Far from all of us, though, are aware of this
inner potential, and we imagine attractiveness instead as a near-mystical
trait that a select few are born with and the rest will never command. Yet all
we need to do to realize our potential is understand what it is in a person's
character that naturally excites people and develop these latent qualities
within us.
Successful seductions rarely begin with an obvious maneuver or strategic device. That is certain to arouse suspicion. Successful seductions begin
with your character, your ability to radiate some quality that attracts people
and stirs their emotions in a way that is beyond their control. Hypnotized
by your seductive character, your victims will not notice your subsequent
manipulations. It will then be child's play to mislead and seduce them.
There are nine seducer types in the world. Each type has a particular
character trait that comes from deep within and creates a seductive pull.
Sirens have an abundance of sexual energy and know how to use it. Rakes
insatiably adore the opposite sex, and their desire is infectious. Ideal Lovers
have an aesthetic sensibility that they apply to romance. Dandies like to play
with their image, creating a striking and androgynous allure. Naturals are
spontaneous and open. Coquettes are self-sufficient, with a fascinating cool
at their core. Charmers want and know how to please—they are social creatures. Charismatics have an unusual confidence in themselves. Stars are ethereal and envelop themselves in mystery.
The chapters in this section will take you inside each of the nine types.
At least one of the chapters should strike a chord—you will recognize part
of yourself. That chapter will be the key to developing your own powers of
attraction. Let us say you have coquettish tendencies. The Coquette chapter will show you how to build upon your own self-sufficiency, alternating
heat and coldness to ensnare your victims. It will show you how to take
your natural qualities further, becoming a grand Coquette, the type we
fight over. There is no point in being timid with a seductive quality. We are
charmed by an unabashed Rake and excuse his excesses, but a halfhearted
Rake gets no respect. Once you have cultivated your dominant character
trait, adding some art to what nature has given you, you can then develop a
second or third trait, adding depth and mystery to your persona. Finally the
section's tenth chapter, on the Anti-Seducer, will make you aware of the op-

posite potential within you—the power of repulsion. At all cost you must
root out any anti-seductive tendencies you may have.
Think of the nine types as shadows, silhouettes. Only by stepping into
one of them and letting it grow inside you can you begin to develop the
seductive character that will bring you limitless power.

The Spectacular Siren
n the year 48 B.C., Ptolemy XIV of Egypt managed to depose and exile
his sister and wife, Queen Cleopatra. He secured the country's borders
against her return and began to rule on his own. Later that year, Julius Caesar came to Alexandria to ensure that despite the local power struggles,
Egypt would remain loyal to Rome.

would suddenly turn cold or angry and he would have to find a way to regain her favor.
The weeks went by. Caesar got rid of all Cleopatra's rivals and found
excuses to stay in Egypt. At one point she led him on a lavish historical expedition down the Nile. In a boat of unimaginable splendor—towering
fifty-four feet out of the water, including several terraced levels and a pillared temple to the god Dionysus—Caesar became one of the few Romans
to gaze on the pyramids. And while he stayed long in Egypt, away from
his throne in Rome, all kinds of turmoil erupted throughout the Roman
Empire.
When Caesar was murdered, in 44 B.C., he was succeeded by a triumvirate of rulers including Mark Antony, a brave soldier who loved pleasure
and spectacle and fancied himself a kind of Roman Dionysus. A few years
later, while Antony was in Syria, Cleopatra invited him to come meet her

Only one image of Cleopatra survives—a barely visible profile on a coin—
but we have numerous written descriptions. She had a long thin face and a
somewhat pointed nose; her dominant features were her wonderfully large
eyes. Her seductive power, however, did not lie in her looks—indeed many
among the women of Alexandria were considered more beautiful than she.
What she did have above all other women was the ability to distract a man.
In reality, Cleopatra was physically unexceptional and had no political
power, yet both Caesar and Antony, brave and clever men, saw none of
this. What they saw was a woman who constantly transformed herself before their eyes, a one-woman spectacle. Her dress and makeup changed
from day to day, but always gave her a heightened, goddesslike appearance.

The Siren • 9

Her voice, which all writers talk of, was lilting and intoxicating. Her words
could be banal enough, but were spoken so sweetly that listeners would
find themselves remembering not what she said but how she said it.
Cleopatra provided constant variety—tributes, mock battles, expeditions, costumed orgies. Everything had a touch of drama and was accomplished with great energy. By the time your head lay on the pillow beside
her, your mind was spinning with images and dreams. And just when you
thought you had this fluid, larger-than-life woman, she would turn distant
or angry, making it clear that everything was on her terms. You never possessed Cleopatra, you worshiped her. In this way a woman who had been
exiled and destined for an early death managed to turn it all around and
rule Egypt for close to twenty years.
From Cleopatra we learn that it is not beauty that makes a Siren but
rather a theatrical streak that allows a woman to embody a man's fantasies.
A man grows bored with a woman, no matter how beautiful; he yearns for
different pleasures, and for adventure. All a woman needs to turn this
around is to create the illusion that she offers such variety and adventure. A
man is easily deceived by appearances; he has a weakness for the visual.
Create the physical presence of a Siren (heightened sexual allure mixed
with a regal and theatrical manner) and he is trapped. He cannot grow
bored with you yet he cannot discard you. Keep up the distractions, and
never let him see who you really are. He will follow you until he drowns.

The Sex Siren
orma Jean Mortensen, the future Marilyn Monroe, spent part of her
childhood in Los Angeles orphanages. Her days were filled with
chores and no play. At school, she kept to herself, smiled rarely, and
dreamed a lot. One day when she was thirteen, as she was dressing for
school, she noticed that the white blouse the orphanage provided for her
was torn, so she had to borrow a sweater from a younger girl in the house.
The sweater was several sizes too small. That day, suddenly, boys seemed to
gather around her wherever she went (she was extremely well-developed
for her age). She wrote in her diary, "They stared at my sweater as if it were
a gold mine."
The revelation was simple but startling. Previously ignored and even
ridiculed by the other students, Norma Jean now sensed a way to gain attention, maybe even power, for she was wildly ambitious. She started to
smile more, wear makeup, dress differently. And soon she noticed something equally startling: without her having to say or do anything, boys fell
passionately in love with her. "My admirers all said the same thing in different ways," she wrote. "It was my fault, their wanting to kiss me and hug
me. Some said it was the way I looked at them—with eyes full of passion.
Others said it was my voice that lured them on. Still others said I gave off
vibrations that floored them."

A few years later Marilyn was trying to make it in the film business.
Producers would tell her the same thing: she was attractive enough in person, but her face wasn't pretty enough for the movies. She was getting
work as an extra, and when she was on-screen—even if only for a few seconds—the men in the audience would go wild, and the theaters would
erupt in catcalls. But nobody saw any star quality in this. One day in 1949,
only twenty-three at the time and her career at a standstill, Monroe met
someone at a diner who told her that a producer casting a new Groucho
Marx movie, Love Happy, was looking for an actress for the part of a blond
bombshell who could walk by Groucho in a way that would, in his words,
"arouse my elderly libido and cause smoke to issue from my ears." Talking
her way into an audition, she improvised this walk. "It's Mae West, Theda
Bara, and Bo Peep all rolled into one," said Groucho after watching her
saunter by. "We shoot the scene tomorrow morning." And so Marilyn created her infamous walk, a walk that was hardly natural but offered a strange
mix of innocence and sex.
Over the next few years, Marilyn taught herself through trial and error how to heighten the effect she had on men. Her voice had always been
attractive—it was the voice of a little girl. But on film it had limitations until someone finally taught her to lower it, giving it the deep, breathy tones
that became her seductive trademark, a mix of the little girl and the vixen.
Before appearing on set, or even at a party, Marilyn would spend hours before the mirror. Most people assumed this was vanity—she was in love with
her image. The truth was that image took hours to create. Marilyn spent
years studying and practicing the art of makeup. The voice, the walk, the
face and look were all constructions, an act. At the height of her fame, she
would get a thrill by going into bars in New York City without her makeup
or glamorous clothes and passing unnoticed.
Success finally came, but with it came something deeply annoying to
her: the studios would only cast her as the blond bombshell. She wanted serious roles, but no one took her seriously for those parts, no matter how
hard she downplayed the siren qualities she had built up. One day, while she
was rehearsing a scene from The Cherry Orchard, her acting instructor, Michael Chekhov, asked her, "Were you thinking of sex while we played the
scene?" When she said no, he continued, "All through our playing of the
scene I kept receiving sex vibrations from you. As if you were a woman in
the grip of passion. . . . I understand your problem with your studio now,
Marilyn. You are a woman who gives off sex vibrations—no matter what
you are doing or thinking. The whole world has already responded to those
vibrations. They come off the movie screens when you are on them."
Marilyn Monroe loved the effect her body could have on the male libido.
She tuned her physical presence like an instrument, making herself reek of
sex and gaining a glamorous, larger-than-life appearance. Other women
knew just as many tricks for heightening their sexual appeal, but what separated Marilyn from them was an unconscious element. Her background

Keys to the Character

T

he Siren is the most ancient seductress of them all. Her prototype is
the goddess Aphrodite—it is her nature to have a mythic quality about
her—but do not imagine she is a thing of the past, or of legend and history: she represents a powerful male fantasy of a highly sexual, supremely
confident, alluring female offering endless pleasure and a bit of danger. In
today's world this fantasy can only appeal the more strongly to the male
psyche, for now more than ever he lives in a world that circumscribes his
aggressive instincts by making everything safe and secure, a world that offers
less chance for adventure and risk than ever before. In the past, a man had
some outlets for these drives—warfare, the high seas, political intrigue. In
the sexual realm, courtesans and mistresses were practically a social institu-

tion, and offered him the variety and the chase that he craved. Without any
outlets, his drives turn inward and gnaw at him, becoming all the more
volatile for being repressed. Sometimes a powerful man will do the most irrational things, have an affair when it is least called for, just for a thrill, the
danger of it all. The irrational can prove immensely seductive, even more
so for men, who must always seem so reasonable.
If it is seductive power you are after, the Siren is the most potent of all.
She operates on a man's most basic emotions, and if she plays her role properly, she can transform a normally strong and responsible male into a childish slave. The Siren operates well on the rigid masculine type—the soldier
or hero—just as Cleopatra overwhelmed Mark Antony and Marilyn Monroe Joe DiMaggio. But never imagine that these are the only types the
Siren can affect. Julius Caesar was a writer and thinker, who had transferred
his intellectual abilities onto the battlefield and into the political arena; the
playwright Arthur Miller fell as deeply under Monroe's spell as DiMaggio.
The intellectual is often the one most susceptible to the Siren call of pure
physical pleasure, because his life so lacks it. The Siren does not have to
worry about finding the right victim. Her magic works on one and all.
First and foremost, a Siren must distinguish herself from other women.
She is by nature a rare thing, mythic, only one to a group; she is also a valuable prize to be wrested away from other men. Cleopatra made herself different through her sense of high drama; the Empress Josephine Bonaparte's
device was her extreme languorousness; Marilyn Monroe's was her littlegirl quality. Physicality offers the best opportunities here, since a Siren is
preeminently a sight to behold. A highly feminine and sexual presence,
even to the point of caricature, will quickly differentiate you, since most
women lack the confidence to project such an image.
Once the Siren has made herself stand out from others, she must have
two other critical qualities: the ability to get the male to pursue her so
feverishly that he loses control; and a touch of the dangerous. Danger is
surprisingly seductive. To get the male to pursue you is relatively simple: a
highly sexual presence will do this quite well. But you must not resemble a
courtesan or whore, whom the male may pursue only to quickly lose interest in her. Instead, you are slightly elusive and distant, a fantasy come to life.
During the Renaissance, the great Sirens, such as Tullia d'Aragona, would
act and look like Grecian goddesses—the fantasy of the day. Today you
might model yourself on a film goddess—anything that seems larger than
life, even awe inspiring. These qualities will make a man chase you vehemently, and the more he chases, the more he will feel that he is acting on
his own initiative. This is an excellent way of disguising how deeply you

female creatures, sing and beckon sailors to their destruction. They sing of
the glories of the past, of a world like childhood, without responsibilities, a
world of pure pleasure. Their voices are like water, liquid and inviting.
Sailors would leap into the water to join them, and drown; or, distracted
and entranced, they would steer their ship into the rocks. To protect his
sailors from the Sirens, Odysseus has their ears filled with wax; he himself is
tied to the mast, so he can both hear the Sirens and live to tell of it—a
strange desire, since the thrill of the Sirens is giving in to the temptation to
follow them.
Just as the ancient sailors had to row and steer, ignoring all distractions,
a man today must work and follow a straight path in life. The call of something dangerous, emotional, unknown is all the more powerful because it is
so forbidden. Think of the victims of the great Sirens of history: Paris
causes a war for the sake of Helen of Troy, Caesar risks an empire and
Antony loses his power and his life for Cleopatra, Napoleon becomes a
laughingstock over Josephine, DiMaggio never gets over Marilyn, and
Arthur Miller can't write for years. A man is often ruined by a Siren, yet
cannot tear himself away. (Many powerful men have a masochistic streak.)
An element of danger is easy to hint at, and will enhance your other Siren
characteristics—the touch of madness in Marilyn, for example, that pulled
men in. Sirens are often fantastically irrational, which is immensely attractive to men who are oppressed by their own reasonableness. An element of
fear is also critical: keeping a man at a proper distance creates respect, so
that he doesn't get close enough to see through you or notice your weaker
qualities. Create such fear by suddenly changing your moods, keeping the
man off balance, occasionally intimidating him with capricious behavior.
The most important element for an aspiring Siren is always the physical,
the Siren's main instrument of power. Physical qualities—a scent, a heightened femininity evoked through makeup or through elaborate or seductive
clothing—act all the more powerfully on men because they have no meaning. In their immediacy they bypass rational processes, having the same effect that a decoy has on an animal, or the movement of a cape on a bull.
The proper Siren appearance is often confused with physical beauty, particularly the face. But a beautiful face does not a Siren make: instead it creates too much distance and coldness. (Neither Cleopatra nor Marilyn
Monroe, the two greatest Sirens in history, were known for their beautiful
faces.) Although a smile and an inviting look are infinitely seductive, they
must never dominate your appearance. They are too obvious and direct.
The Siren must stimulate a generalized desire, and the best way to do this is
by creating an overall impression that is both distracting and alluring. It is
not one particular trait, but a combination of qualities:

The voice. Clearly a critical quality, as the legend indicates, the Siren's
voice has an immediate animal presence with incredible suggestive power.
Perhaps that power is regressive, recalling the ability of the mother's voice

to calm or excite her child even before the child understood what she was
saying. The Siren must have an insinuating voice that hints at the erotic,
more often subliminally than overtly. Almost everyone who met Cleopatra
commented on her delightful, sweet-sounding voice, which had a mesmerizing quality. The Empress Josephine, one of the great seductresses of the
late eighteenth century, had a languorous voice that men found exotic, and
suggestive of her Creole origins. Marilyn Monroe was born with her
breathy, childlike voice, but she learned to lower to make it truly seductive.
Lauren Bacall's voice is naturally low; its seductive power comes from its
slow, suggestive delivery. The Siren never speaks quickly, aggressively, or at
a high pitch. Her voice is calm and unhurried, as if she had never quite
woken up—or left her bed.

Body and adornment. If the voice must lull, the body and its adornment
must dazzle. It is with her clothes that the Siren aims to create the goddess effect that Baudelaire described in his essay "In Praise of Makeup":
"Woman is well within her rights, and indeed she is accomplishing a kind
of duty in striving to appear magical and supernatural. She must astonish
and bewitch; an idol, she must adorn herself with gold in order to be
adored. She must borrow from all of the arts in order to raise herself above
nature, the better to subjugate hearts and stir souls."
A Siren who was a genius of clothes and adornment was Pauline Bonaparte, sister of Napoleon. Pauline consciously strove for a goddess effect,
fashioning hair, makeup, and clothes to evoke the look and air of Venus,
the goddess of love. No one in history could boast a more extensive and
elaborate wardrobe. Pauline's entrance at a ball in 1798 created an astounding effect. She asked the hostess, Madame Permon, if she could dress at her
house, so no one would see her clothes as she came in. When she came
down the stairs, everyone stopped dead in stunned silence. She wore the
headdress of a bacchante—clusters of gold grapes interlaced in her hair,
which was done up in the Greek style. Her Greek tunic, with its goldembroidered hem, showed off her goddesslike figure. Below her breasts was
a girdle of burnished gold, held by a magnificent jewel. "No words can
convey the loveliness of her appearance," wrote the Duchess d'Abrantes.
"The very room grew brighter as she entered. The whole ensemble was so
harmonious that her appearance was greeted with a buzz of admiration
which continued with utter disregard of all the other women."
The key: everything must dazzle, but must also be harmonious, so that
no single ornament draws attention. Your presence must be charged, larger
than life, a fantasy come true. Ornament is used to cast a spell and distract.
The Siren can also use clothing to hint at the sexual, at times overtly but
more often by suggesting it rather than screaming it—that would make you
seem manipulative. Related to this is the notion of selective disclosure, the
revealing of only a part of the body—but a part that will excite and stir the
imagination. In the late sixteenth century, Marguerite de Valois, the infa-

mous daughter of Queen Catherine de Médicis of France, was one of the
first women ever to incorporate decolletage in her wardrobe, simply because she had the most beautiful breasts in the realm. For Josephine Bonaparte it was her arms, which she carefully always left bare.

Movement and demeanor. In the fifth century B.C., King Kou Chien
chose the Chinese Siren Hsi Shih from among all the women of his realm
to seduce and destroy his rival Fu Chai, King of Wu; for this purpose, he
had the young woman instructed in the arts of seduction. Most important
of these was movement—how to move gracefully and suggestively. Hsi
Shih learned to give the impression of floating across the floor in her court
robes. When she was finally unleashed on Fu Chai, he quickly fell under
her spell. She walked and moved like no one he had ever seen. He became
obsessed with her tremulous presence, her manner and nonchalant air. Fu
Chai fell so deeply in love that he let his kingdom fall to pieces, allowing
Kou Chien to march in and conquer it without a fight.
The Siren moves gracefully and unhurriedly. The proper gestures,
movement, and demeanor for a Siren are like the proper voice: they hint at
something exciting, stirring desire without being obvious. Your air must be
languorous, as if you had all the time in the world for love and pleasure.
Your gestures must have a certain ambiguity, suggesting something both
innocent and erotic. Anything that cannot immediately be understood is
supremely seductive, and all the more so if it permeates your manner.

Symbol: Water.
The song of the Siren is liquid and
enticing, and the Siren herself is fluid and ungraspable. Like the sea, the Siren lures you with the
promise of infinite adventure and pleasure. Forgetting past
and future, men follow her far out to sea, where they drown.

Dangers

N

o matter how enlightened the age, no woman can maintain the image
of being devoted to pleasure completely comfortably. And no matter
how hard she tries to distance herself from it, the taint of being easy always
follows the Siren. Cleopatra was hated in Rome as the Egyptian whore.
That hatred eventually lead to her downfall, as Octavius and the Roman
army sought to extirpate the stain on Roman manhood that she came to
represent. Even so, men are often forgiving when it comes to the Siren's
reputation. But danger often lies in the envy she stirs up among other
women; much of Rome's hatred for Cleopatra originated in the resentment
she provoked among the city's stern matrons. By playing up her innocence,
by making herself seem the victim of male desire, the Siren can somewhat
blunt the effects of feminine envy. But on the whole there is little she can
do—her power comes from her effect on men, and she must learn to accept, or ignore, the envy of other women.
Finally, the intense attention that the Siren attracts can prove irritating
and worse. Sometimes she will pine for relief from it; sometimes, too, she
will want to attract an attention that is not sexual. Also, unfortunately,
physical beauty fades; although the Siren effect depends not on a beautiful
face but on an overall impression, past a certain age that impression gets
hard to project. Both of these factors contributed to the suicide of Marilyn
Monroe. It takes a genius on the level of Madame de Pompadour, the Siren
mistress of King Louis XV, to make the transition into the role of the spirited older woman who continues to seduce with her nonphysical charms.
Cleopatra had such an intellect, and had she lived long enough, she would
have remained a potent seductress for many years. The Siren must prepare
for age by paying attention early on to the more psychological, less physical
forms of coquetry that can continue to bring her power once her beauty
starts to fade.

fought a pistol duel over the duke, and one of them was seriously
wounded. The Duchess d'Orléans, Richelieu's most bitter enemy, once
wrote, "If I believed in sorcery I should think that the Duke possessed
some supernatural secret, for I have never known a woman to oppose the
very least resistance to him."
In seduction there is often a dilemma: to seduce you need planning and calculation, but if your victim suspects that you have ulterior motives, she will
grow defensive. Furthermore, if you seem to be in control, you will inspire
fear instead of desire. The Ardent Rake solves this dilemma in the most artful manner. Of course he must calculate and plan—he has to find a way
around the jealous husband, or whatever the obstacle is. It is exhausting
work. But by nature, the Ardent Rake also has the advantage of an uncontrollable libido. When he pursues a woman, he really is aglow with desire;
the victim senses this and is inflamed, even despite herself. How can she
imagine that he is a heartless seducer who will abandon her when he so ardently braves all dangers and obstacles to get to her? And even if she is
aware of his rakish past, of his incorrigible amorality, it doesn't matter, because she also sees his weakness. He cannot control himself; he actually is a
slave to all women. As such he inspires no fear.
The Ardent Rake teaches us a simple lesson: intense desire has a distracting power on a woman, just as the Siren's physical presence does on a
man. A woman is often defensive and can sense insincerity or calculation.
But if she feels consumed by your attentions, and is confident you will do
anything for her, she will notice nothing else about you, or will find a way
to forgive your indiscretions. This is the perfect cover for a seducer. The
key is to show no hesitation, to abandon all restraint, to let yourself go, to
show that you cannot control yourself and are fundamentally weak. Do not
worry about inspiring mistrust; as long as you are the slave to her charms,
she will not think of the aftermath.

The Demonic Rake
n the early 1880s, members of Roman high society began to talk of a
young journalist who had arrived on the scene, a certain Gabriele D'Annunzio. This was strange in itself, for Italian royalty had only the deepest
contempt for anyone outside their circle, and a newspaper society reporter
was almost as low as you could go. Indeed well-born men paid D'Annunzio little attention. He had no money and few connections, coming from a
strictly middle-class background. Besides, to them he was downright
ugly—short and stocky, with a dark, splotchy complexion and bulging eyes.
The men thought him so unappealing they gladly let him mingle with their
wives and daughters, certain that their women would be safe with this gargoyle and happy to get this gossip hunter off their hands. No, it was not the

Seduction is a psychological process that transcends gender, except in a few
key areas where each gender has its own weakness. The male is traditionally
vulnerable to the visual. The Siren who can concoct the right physical appearance will seduce in large numbers. For women the weakness is language and words: as was written by one of D'Annunzio's victims, the
French actress Simone, "How can one explain his conquests except by his
extraordinary verbal power, and the musical timbre of his voice, put to the
service of exceptional eloquence? For my sex is susceptible to words, bewitched by them, longing to be dominated by them."
The Rake is as promiscuous with words as he is with women. He
chooses words for their ability to suggest, insinuate, hypnotize, elevate, in-

feet. The words of the Rake are the equivalent of the bodily adornment of
the Siren: a powerful sensual distraction, a narcotic. The Rake's use of language is demonic because it is designed not to communicate or convey information but to persuade, flatter, stir emotional turmoil, much as the
serpent in the Garden of Eden used words to lead Eve into temptation.
The example of D'Annunzio reveals the link between the erotic Rake,
who seduces women, and the political Rake, who seduces the masses. Both
depend on words. Adapt the character of the Rake and you will find that
the use of words as a subtle poison has infinite applications. Remember: it
is the form that matters, not the content. The less your targets focus on
what you say, and the more on how it makes them feel, the more seductive
your effect. Give your words a lofty, spiritual, literary flavor the better to insinuate desire in your unwitting victims.
But what is this force, then, by which Don Juan seduces?
It is desire, the energy of sensuous desire. He desires in
every woman the whole of womanhood. The reaction to
this gigantic passion beautifies and develops the one desired, who flushes in enhanced beauty by his reflection. As
the enthusiast's fire with seductive splendor illumines even
those who stand in a casual relation to him, so Don Juan
transfigures in a far deeper sense every girl.
—SØREN KIERKEGAARD, EITHER/OR

Keys to the Character
t first it may seem strange that a man who is clearly dishonest, disloyal,
and has no interest in marriage would have any appeal to a woman.
But throughout all of history, and in all cultures, this type has had a fatal effect. What the Rake offers is what society normally does not allow women:
an affair of pure pleasure, an exciting brush with danger. A woman is often
deeply oppressed by the role she is expected to play She is supposed to be
the tender, civilizing force in society, and to want commitment and lifelong
loyalty. But often her marriages and relationships give her not romance and
devotion but routine and an endlessly distracted mate. It remains an abiding
female fantasy to meet a man who gives totally of himself, who lives for
her, even if only for a while.
This dark, repressed side of female desire found expression in the legend of Don Juan. At first the legend was a male fantasy: the adventurous
knight who could have any woman he wanted. But in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, Don Juan slowly evolved from the masculine adventurer to a more feminized version: a man who lived only for women. This
evolution came from women's interest in the story, and was a result of their
frustrated desires. Marriage for them was a form of indentured servitude;
but Don Juan offered pleasure for its own sake, desire with no strings at-

tached. For the time he crossed your path, you were all he thought about.
His desire for you was so powerful that he gave you no time to think or to
worry about the consequences. He would come in the night, give you an
unforgettable moment, and then vanish. He might have conquered a thousand women before you, but that only made him more interesting; better to
be abandoned than undesired by such a man.
The great seducers do not offer the mild pleasures that society condones. They touch a person's unconscious, those repressed desires that cry
out for liberation. Do not imagine that women are the tender creatures that
some people would like them to be. Like men, they are deeply attracted to
the forbidden, the dangerous, even the slightly evil. (Don Juan ends by going to hell, and the word "rake" comes from "rakehell," a man who rakes
the coals of hell; the devilish component, clearly, is an important part of
the fantasy.) Always remember: if you are to play the Rake, you must convey a sense of risk and darkness, suggesting to your victim that she is participating in something rare and thrilling—a chance to play out her own rakish
desires.
To play the Rake, the most obvious requirement is the ability to let
yourself go, to draw a woman into the kind of purely sensual moment in
which past and future lose meaning. You must be able to abandon yourself
to the moment. (When the Rake Valmont—a character modeled after the
Duke de Richelieu—in Laclos' eighteenth-century novel Dangerous Liaisons
writes letters that are obviously calculated to have a certain effect on his
chosen victim, Madame de Tourvel, she sees right through them; but when
his letters really do burn with passion, she begins to relent.) An added
benefit of this quality is that it makes you seem unable to control yourself, a
display of weakness that a woman enjoys. By abandoning yourself to the
seduced, you make them feel that you exist for them alone—a feeling reflecting a truth, though a temporary one. Of the hundreds of women that
Pablo Picasso, consummate rake, seduced over the years, most of them had
the feeling that they were the only one he truly loved.
The Rake never worries about a woman's resistance to him, or for that
matter about any other obstacle in his path—a husband, a physical barrier.
Resistance is only the spur to his desire, enflaming him all the more. When
Picasso was seducing Françoise Gilot, in fact, he begged her to resist; he
needed resistance to add to the thrill. In any case, an obstacle in your way
gives you the opportunity to prove yourself, and the creativity you bring to
matters of love. In the eleventh-century Japanese novel The Tale of Genji, by
the court lady Murasaki Shikibu, the Rake Prince Niou is not disturbed by
the sudden disappearance of Ukifune, the woman he loves. She has fled because although she is interested in the prince, she is in love with another
man; but her absence allows the prince to go to extreme lengths to track
her down. His sudden appearance to whisk her away to a house deep in the
woods, and the gallantry he displays in doing so, overwhelm her. Remember: if no resistances or obstacles face you, you must create them. No seduction can proceed without them.

The Art of Seduction

The Rake is an extreme personality. Impudent, sarcastic, and bitingly
witty, he cares nothing for what anyone thinks. Paradoxically, this only
makes him more seductive. In the courtlike atmosphere of studio-era Hollywood, when most of the actors behaved like dutiful sheep, the great Rake
Errol Flynn stood out in his insolence. He defied the studio chiefs, engaged
in the most extreme pranks, reveled in his reputation as Hollywood's
supreme seducer—all of which enhanced his popularity. The Rake needs a
backdrop of convention—a stultified court, a humdrum marriage, a conservative culture—to shine, to be appreciated for the breath of fresh air he
provides. Never worry about going too far: the Rake's essence is that he
goes further than anyone else.
When the Earl of Rochester, seventeenth-century England's most notorious Rake and poet, abducted Elizabeth Malet, one of the most soughtafter young ladies of the court, he was duly punished. But lo and behold, a
few years later young Elizabeth, though wooed by the most eligible bachelors in the country, chose Rochester to be her husband. In demonstrating
his audacious desire, he made himself stand out from the crowd.
Related to the Rake's extremism is the sense of danger, taboo, perhaps
even the hint of cruelty about him. This was the appeal of another poet
Rake, one of the greatest in history: Lord Byron. Byron disliked any kind
of convention, and happily played this up. When he had an affair with his
half sister, who bore a child by him, he made sure that all of England knew
about it. He could be uncommonly cruel, as he was to his wife. But all of
this only made him that much more desirable. Danger and taboo appeal to
a repressed side in women, who are supposed to represent a civilizing, moralizing force in culture. Just as a man may fall victim to the Siren through
his desire to be free of his sense of masculine responsibility, a woman may
succumb to the Rake through her yearning to be free of the constraints of
virtue and decency. Indeed it is often the most virtuous woman who falls
most deeply in love with the Rake.
Among the Rake's most seductive qualities is his ability to make women
want to reform him. How many thought they would be the one to tame
Lord Byron; how many of Picasso's women thought they would finally be
the one with whom he would spend the rest of his life. You must exploit
this tendency to the fullest. When caught red-handed in rakishness, fall
back on your weakness—your desire to change, and your inability to do so.
With so many women at your feet, what can you do? You are the one who
is the victim. You need help. Women will jump at this opportunity; they
are uncommonly indulgent of the Rake, for he is such a pleasant, dashing
figure. The desire to reform him disguises the true nature of their desire,
the secret thrill they get from him. When President Bill Clinton was clearly
caught out as a Rake, it was women who rushed to his defense, finding
every possible excuse for him. The fact that the Rake is so devoted to
women, in his own strange way, makes him lovable and seductive to them.
Finally, a Rake's greatest asset is his reputation. Never downplay your
bad name, or seem to apologize for it. Instead, embrace it, enhance it. It is

what draws women to you. There are several things you must be known
for: your irresistible attractiveness to women; your uncontrollable devotion
to pleasure (this will make you seem weak, but also exciting to be around);
your disdain for convention; a rebellious streak that makes you seem dangerous. This last element can be slightly hidden; on the surface, be polite
and civil, while letting it be known that behind the scenes you are incorrigible. Duke de Richelieu made his conquests as public as possible, exciting
other women's competitive desire to join the club of the seduced. It was by
reputation that Lord Byron attracted his willing victims. A woman may feel
ambivalent about President Clinton's reputation, but beneath that ambivalence is an underlying interest. Do not leave your reputation to chance or
gossip; it is your life's artwork, and you must craft it, hone it, and display it
with the care of an artist.

Dangers
ike the Siren, the Rake faces the most danger from members of his
own sex, who are far less indulgent than women are of his constant
skirt chasing. In the old days, a Rake was often an aristocrat, and no matter
how many people he offended or even killed, in the end he would go unpunished. Today, only stars and the very wealthy can play the Rake with
impunity; the rest of us need to be careful.
Elvis Presley had been a shy young man. Attaining early stardom, and
seeing the power it gave him over women, he went berserk, becoming a
Rake almost overnight. Like many Rakes, Elvis had a predilection for
women who were already taken. He found himself cornered by an angry
husband or boyfriend on numerous occasions, and came away with a few
cuts and bruises. This might seem to suggest that you should step lightly
around husbands and boyfriends, especially early on in your career. But the
charm of the Rake is that such dangers don't matter to them. You cannot
be a Rake by being fearful and prudent; the occasional pummeling is part
of the game. Later on, in any case, at the height of Elvis's fame, no husband
would dare touch him.
The greater danger for the Rake comes not from the violently offended
husband but from those insecure men who feel threatened by the Don Juan
figure. Although they will not admit it, they envy the Rake's life of pleasure, and like everyone envious, they will attack in hidden ways, often
masking their persecutions as morality. The Rake may find his career endangered by such men (or by the occasional woman who is equally insecure, and who feels hurt because the Rake does not want her). There is
little the Rake can do to avoid envy; if everyone was as successful in seduction, society would not function.
So accept envy as a badge of honor. Don't be naive, be aware. When
attacked by a moralist persecutor, do not be taken in by their crusade; it is
motivated by envy, pure and simple. You can blunt it by being less of a
Rake, asking forgiveness, claiming to have reformed, but this will damage
your reputation, making you seem less lovably rakish. In the end, it is better
to suffer attacks with dignity and keep on seducing. Seduction is the source
of your power; and you can always count on the infinite indulgence of
women.

The gentleman turned out to be Casanova, and what a gentleman he

occasional companionship. Miss Pauline moved in. They played chess, went
riding, discussed literature. He was so well-bred, polite, and generous. A serious and high-minded girl, she came to depend on their friendship; here
was a man she could talk to for hours. Then one day Casanova seemed
changed, upset, excited: he confessed that he was in love with her. She was
going back to Portugal soon, to rejoin her lover, and this was not what she
wanted to hear. She told him he should go riding to calm down.
Later that evening she received news: he had fallen from his horse. Feeling responsible for his accident, she rushed to him, found him in bed, and
fell into his arms, unable to control herself. The two became lovers that
night, and remained so for the rest of Miss Pauline's stay in London. Yet
when it came time for her to leave for Portugal, he did not try to stop her;
instead, he comforted her, reasoning that each of them had offered the
other the perfect, temporary antidote to their loneliness, and that they
would
be friends for life.

named Ignazia was leaving church after confession. She was approached by
Casanova. Walking her home, he explained that he had a passion for dancing the fandango, and invited her to a ball the following evening. He was so
different from anyone in the town, which bored her so—she desperately
wanted to go. Her parents were against the arrangement, but she persuaded
her mother to act as a chaperone. After an unforgettable evening of dancing (and he danced the fandango remarkably well for a foreigner), Casanova confessed that he was madly in love with her. She replied (very sadly,
though) that she already had a fiancé. Casanova did not force the issue, but
over the next few days he took Ignazia to more dances and to the bullfights.
On one of these occasions he introduced her to a friend of his, a duchess,
who flirted with him brazenly; Ignazia was terribly jealous. By now she was
desperately in love with Casanova, but her sense of duty and religion forbade such thoughts.
Finally, after days of torment, Ignazia sought out Casanova and took his
hand: "My confessor tried to make me promise to never be alone with you
again," she said, "and as I could not, he refused to give me absolution. It is
the first time in my life such a thing has happened to me. I have put myself
in God's hands. I have made up my mind, so long as you are here, to do all
you wish. When to my sorrow you leave Spain, I shall find another confessor. My fancy for you is, after all, only a passing madness."

study her, go along with her moods, find out what was missing in her life,
and provide it. He made himself the Ideal Lover. The bored burgomaster's
wife needed adventure and romance; she wanted someone who would sacrifice time and comfort to have her. For Miss Pauline what was missing was
friendship, lofty ideals, serious conversation; she wanted a man of breeding
and generosity who would treat her like a lady. For Ignazia, what was missing was suffering and torment. Her life was too easy; to feel truly alive, and
to have something real to confess, she needed to sin. In each case Casanova
adapted himself to the woman's ideals, brought her fantasy to life. Once she
had fallen under his spell, a little ruse or calculation would seal the romance
(a day among rats, a contrived fall from a horse, an encounter with another
woman to make Ignazia jealous).
The Ideal Lover is rare in the modern world, for the role takes effort.
You will have to focus intensely on the other person, fathom what she is
missing, what he is disappointed by. People will often reveal this in subtle
ways: through gesture, tone of voice, a look in the eye. By seeming to be
what they lack, you will fit their ideal.
To create this effect requires patience and attention to detail. Most
people are so wrapped up in their own desires, so impatient, they are incapable of the Ideal Lover role. Let that be a source of infinite opportunity.
Be an oasis in the desert of the self-absorbed; few can resist the temptation
of following a person who seems so attuned to their desires, to bringing to
life their fantasies. And as with Casanova, your reputation as one who
gives such pleasure will precede you and make your seductions that much

n 1730, when Jeanne Poisson was a mere nine years old, a fortune-teller
predicted that one day she would be the mistress of Louis XV. The prediction was quite ridiculous, since Jeanne came from the middle class, and
it was a tradition stretching back for centuries that the king's mistress be
chosen from among the nobility. To make matters worse, Jeanne's father
was a notorious rake, and her mother had been a courtesan.
Fortunately for Jeanne, one of her mother's lovers was a man of great
wealth who took a liking to the pretty girl and paid for her education.
Jeanne learned to sing, to play the clavichord, to ride with uncommon skill,
to act and dance; she was schooled in literature and history as if she were a
boy. The playwright Crébillon instructed her in the art of conversation.

— V I R G I N I A WOOLF, A ROOM court, that same year he made this middle-class woman his official mistress,
OF ONE'S OWN ennobling her with the title of the Marquise de Pompadour.
The king's need for novelty was notorious: a mistress would beguile
him with her looks, but he would soon grow bored with her and find
someone else. After the shock of his choice of Jeanne Poisson wore off, the
courtiers reassured themselves that it could not last—that he had only chosen her for the novelty of having a middle-class mistress. Little did they
know that Jeanne s first seduction of the king was not the last seduction she
had in mind.
As time went by, the king found himself visiting his mistress more and
more often. As he ascended the hidden stair that led from his quarters to
hers in the palace of Versailles, anticipation of the delights that awaited him
at the top would begin to turn his head. First, the room was always warm,
and was filled with delightful scents. Then there were the visual delights:
Madame de Pompadour always wore a different costume, each one elegant
and surprising in its own way. She loved beautiful objects—fine porcelain,
Chinese fans, golden flowerpots—and every time he visited, there would
be something new and enchanting to see. Her manner was always lighthearted; she was never defensive or resentful. Everything for pleasure. Then
there was their conversation: he had never been really able to talk with a
woman before, or to laugh, but the marquise could discourse skillfully on
any subject, and her voice was a pleasure to hear. And if the conversation
waned, she would move to the piano, play a tune, and sing wonderfully.
If ever the king seemed bored or sad, Madame de Pompadour would
propose some project—perhaps the building of a new country house. He
would have to advise in the design, the layout of the gardens, the decor.
Back at Versailles, Madame de Pompadour put hersell in charge of the
palace amusements, building a private theater for weekly performances under her direction. Actors were chosen from among the courtiers, but the
female lead was always played by Madame de Pompadour, who was one of
the finest amateur actresses in France. The king became obsessed with this
sure indication that the
sitter intended to secure a
posthumous fame as well.

theater; he could barely wait for its performances. Along with this interest
came an increasing expenditure of money on the arts, and an involvement
in philosophy and literature. A man who had cared only for hunting and
gambling was spending less and less time with his male companions and becoming a great patron of the arts. Indeed he stamped a whole era with an
aesthetic style, which became known as "Louis Quinze," rivaling the style
associated with his illustrious predecessor, Louis XIV.
Lo and behold, year after year went by without Louis tiring of his mistress. In fact he made her a duchess, and her power and influence extended
well beyond culture into politics. For twenty years, Madame de Pompadour
ruled both the court and the king's heart, until her untimely death, in
1764, at the age of forty-three.
Louis XV had a powerful inferiority complex. The successor to Louis XIV,
the most powerful king in French history, he had been educated and
trained for the throne—yet who could follow his predecessor's act? Eventually he gave up trying, devoting himself instead to physical pleasures, which
came to define how he was seen; the people around him knew they could
sway him by appealing to the basest parts of his character.
Madame de Pompadour, genius of seduction, understood that inside
Louis XV was a great man yearning to come out, and that his obsession
with pretty young women indicated a hunger for a more lasting kind of
beauty. Her first step was to cure his incessant bouts of boredom. It is easy
for kings to be bored—everything they want is given to them, and they seldom learn to be satisfied with what they have. The Marquise de Pompadour dealt with this by bringing all sorts of fantasies to life, and creating
constant suspense. She had many skills and talents, and just as important,
she deployed them so artfully that he never discovered their limits. Once
she had accustomed him to more refined pleasures, she appealed to the
crushed ideals within him; in the mirror she held up to him, he saw his aspiration to be great, a desire that, in France, inevitably included leadership
in culture. His previous series of mistresses had tickled only his sensual desires. In Madame de Pompadour he found a woman who made him feel
greatness in himself. The other mistresses could easily be replaced, but he
could never find another Madame de Pompadour.
Most people believe themselves to be inwardly greater than they outwardly appear to the world. They are full of unrealized ideals: they could
be artists, thinkers, leaders, spiritual figures, but the world has crushed
them, denied them the chance to let their abilities flourish. This is the key
to their seduction—and to keeping them seduced over time. The Ideal
Lover knows how to conjure up this kind of magic. Appeal only to people's
physical side, as many amateur seducers do, and they will resent you for
playing upon their basest instincts. But appeal to their better selves, to a
higher standard of beauty, and they will hardly notice that they have been
seduced. Make them feel elevated, lofty, spiritual, and your power over
them will be limitless.

Love brings to light a lover's noble and hidden qualities—
his rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to his normal character.
—FRIEDRICH

Keys to the Character

E

ach of us carries inside us an ideal, either of what we would like to become, or of what we want another person to be for us. This ideal goes
back to our earliest years—to what we once felt was missing in our lives,
what others did not give to us, what we could not give to ourselves. Maybe
we were smothered in comfort, and we long for danger and rebellion. If we
want danger but it frightens us, perhaps we look for someone who seems at
home with it. Or perhaps our ideal is more elevated—we want to be more
creative, nobler, and kinder than we ever manage to be. Our ideal is something we feel is missing inside us.
Our ideal may be buried in disappointment, but it lurks underneath,
waiting to be sparked. If another person seems to have that ideal quality, or
to have the ability to bring it out in us, we fall in love. That is the response
to Ideal Lovers. Attuned to what is missing inside you, to the fantasy that
will stir you, they reflect your ideal—and you do the rest, projecting on to
them your deepest desires and yearnings. Casanova and Madame de Pompadour did not merely seduce their targets into a sexual affair, they made
them fall in love.
The key to following the path of the Ideal Lover is the ability to observe. Ignore your targets' words and conscious behavior; focus on the tone
of their voice, a blush here, a look there—those signs that betray what
their words won't say. Often the ideal is expressed in contradiction. King
Louis XV seemed to care only about chasing deer and young girls, but that
in fact covered up his disappointment in himself; he yearned to have his nobler qualities flattered.
Never has there been a better moment than now to play the Ideal
Lover. That is because we live in a world in which everything must seem
elevated and well-intentioned. Power is the most taboo topic of all: although it is the reality we deal with every day in our struggles with people,
there is nothing noble, self-sacrificing, or spiritual about it. Ideal Lovers
make you feel nobler, make the sensual and sexual seem spiritual and aesthetic. Like all seducers, they play with power, but they disguise their manipulations behind the facade of an ideal. Few people see through them
and their seductions last longer.
Some ideals resemble Jungian archetypes—they go back a long way
in our culture, and their hold is almost unconscious. One such dream is
that of the chivalrous knight. In the courtly love tradition of the Middle
Ages, a troubadour/knight would find a lady, almost always a married one,

and would serve as her vassal. He would go through terrible trials on her
behalf, undertake dangerous pilgrimages in her name, suffer awful tortures
to prove his love. (This could include bodily mutilation, such as tearing off
of fingernails, the cutting of an ear, etc.) He would also write poems and
sing beautiful songs to her, for no troubadour could succeed without some
kind of aesthetic or spiritual quality to impress his lady. The key to the archetype is a sense of absolute devotion. A man who will not let matters of
warfare, glory, or money intrude into the fantasy of courtship has limitless
power. The troubadour role is an ideal because people who do not put
themselves and their own interests first are truly rare. For a woman to attract the intense attention of such a man is immensely appealing to her
vanity.
In eighteenth-century Osaka, a man named Nisan took the courtesan
Dewa out walking, first taking care to sprinkle the clover bushes along the
path with water, which looked like morning dew. Dewa was greatly moved
by this beautiful sight. "I have heard," she said, "that loving couples of deer
are wont to lie behind clover bushes. How I should like to see this in real
life!" Nisan had heard enough. That very day he had a section of her house
torn down and ordered the planting of dozens of clover bushes in what had
once been a part of her bedroom. That night, he arranged for peasants to
round up wild deer from the mountains and bring them to the house. The
next day Dewa awoke to precisely the scene she had described. Once she
appeared overwhelmed and moved, he had the clover and deer taken away
and the house rebuilt.
One of history's most gallant lovers, Sergei Saltykov, had the misfortune
to fall in love with one of history's least available women: the Grand Duchess
Catherine, future empress of Russia. Catherine's every move was watched
over by her husband, Peter, who suspected her of trying to cheat on him
and appointed servants to keep an eye on her. She was isolated, unloved,
and unable to do anything about it. Saltykov, a handsome young army officer, was determined to be her rescuer. In 1752 he befriended Peter, and
also the couple in charge of watching over Catherine. In this way he was
able to see her and occasionally exchange a word or two with her that revealed his intentions. He performed the most foolhardy and dangerous maneuvers to be able to see her alone, including diverting her horse during a
royal hunt and riding off into the forest with her. He told her how much
he sympathized with her plight, and that he would do anything to help her.
To be caught courting Catherine would have meant death, and eventually Peter came to suspect that something was up between his wife and
Saltykov, though he was never sure. His enmity did not discourage the
dashing officer, who just put still more energy and ingenuity into finding
ways to arrange secret trysts. The couple were lovers for two years, and
Saltykov was undoubtedly the father of Catherine's son Paul, later the emperor of Russia. When Peter finally got rid of him by sending him off to
Sweden, news of his gallantry traveled ahead of him, and women swooned

to be his next conquest. You may not have to go to as much trouble or risk,
but you will always be rewarded for actions that reveal a sense of selfsacrifice or devotion.
The embodiment of the Ideal Lover for the 1920s was Rudolph Valentino, or at least the image created of him in film. Everything he did—the
gifts, the flowers, the dancing, the way he took a woman's hand—showed a
scrupulous attention to the details that would signify how much he was
thinking of her. The image was of a man who made courtship take time,
transforming it into an aesthetic experience. Men hated Valentino, because
women now expected them to match the ideal of patience and attentiveness that he represented. Yet nothing is more seductive than patient attentiveness. It makes the affair seem lofty, aesthetic, not really about sex. The
power of a Valentino, particularly nowadays, is that people like this are so
rare. The art of playing to a woman's ideal has almost disappeared—which
only makes it that much more alluring.
If the chivalrous lover remains the ideal for women, men often idealize
the Madonna/whore, a woman who combines sensuality with an air of
spirituality or innocence. Think of the great courtesans of the Italian Renaissance, such as Tullia d'Aragona—essentially a prostitute, like all courtesans, but able to disguise her social role by establishing a reputation as a poet
and philosopher. Tullia was what was then known as an "honest courtesan."
Honest courtesans would go to church, but they had an ulterior motive: for
men, their presence at Mass was exciting. Their houses were pleasure
palaces, but what made these homes so visually delightful was their artworks and shelves full of books, volumes of Petrarch and Dante. For the
man, the thrill, the fantasy, was to sleep with a woman who was sexual yet
had the ideal qualities of a mother and the spirit and intellect of an artist.
Where the pure prostitute excited desire but also disgust, the honest courtesan made sex seem elevated and innocent, as if it were happening in the
Garden of Eden. Such women held immense power over men. To this day
they remain an ideal, if for no other reason than that they offer such a range
of pleasures. The key is ambiguity—to combine the appearance of sensitivity to the pleasures of the flesh with an air of innocence, spirituality, a
poetic sensibility. This mix of the high and the low is immensely seductive.
The dynamics of the Ideal Lover have limitless possibilities, not all of
them erotic. In politics, Talleyrand essentially played the role of the Ideal
Lover with Napoleon, whose ideal in both a cabinet minister and a friend
was a man who was aristocratic, smooth with the ladies—all the things that
Napoleon himself was not. In 1798, when Talleyrand was the French foreign minister, he hosted a party in Napoleon's honor after the great general's dazzling military victories in Italy. To the day Napoleon died, he
remembered this party as the best he had ever attended. It was a lavish affair, and Talleyrand wove a subtle message into it by placing Roman busts
around the house, and by talking to Napoleon of reviving the imperial glories of ancient Rome. This sparked a glint in the leader's eye, and indeed, a
few years later, Napoleon gave himself the title of emperor—a move that

The Ideal Lover •

only made Talleyrand more powerful. The key to Talleyrand's power was
his ability to fathom Napoleon's secret ideal: his desire to be an emperor, a
dictator. Talleyrand simply held up a mirror to Napoleon and let him
glimpse that possibility. People are always vulnerable to insinuations like
this, which stroke their vanity, almost everyone's weak spot. Hint at something for them to aspire to, reveal your faith in some untapped potential
you see in them, and you will soon have them eating out of your hand.
If Ideal Lovers are masters at seducing people by appealing to their
higher selves, to something lost from their childhood, politicians can benefit by applying this skill on a mass scale, to an entire electorate. This was
what John F. Kennedy quite deliberately did with the American public,
most obviously in creating the "Camelot" aura around himself. The word
"Camelot" was applied to his presidency only after his death, but the romance he consciously projected through his youth and good looks was fully
functioning during his lifetime. More subtly, he also played with America's
images of its own greatness and lost ideals. Many Americans felt that with
the wealth and comfort of the late 1950s had come great losses; ease and
conformity had buried the country's pioneer spirit. Kennedy appealed to
those lost ideals through the imagery of the New Frontier, which was exemplified by the space race. The American instinct for adventure could
find outlets here, even if most of them were symbolic. And there were
other calls for public service, such as the creation of the Peace Corps.
Through appeals like these, Kennedy resparked the uniting sense of mission
that had gone missing in America during the years since World War II. He
also attracted to himself a more emotional response than presidents commonly got. People literally fell in love with him and the image.
Politicians can gain seductive power by digging into a country's past,
bringing images and ideals that have been abandoned or repressed back to
the surface. They only need the symbol; they do not really have to worry
about re-creating the reality behind it. The good feelings they stir up are
enough to ensure a positive response.

Dangers
he main dangers in the role of the Ideal Lover are the consequences
that arise if you let reality creep in. You are creating a fantasy that involves an idealization of your own character. And this is a precarious task,
for you are human, and imperfect. If your faults are ugly enough, or intrusive enough, they will burst the bubble you have blown, and your target
will revile you. Whenever Tullia d'Aragona was caught acting like a common prostitute (when, for instance, she was caught having an affair just for
money), she would have to leave town and establish herself elsewhere. The
fantasy of her as a spiritual figure was broken. Casanova too faced this danger, but was usually able to surmount it by finding a clever way to break off
the relationship before the woman realized that he was not what she had
imagined: he would find some excuse to leave town, or, better still, he
would choose a victim who was herself leaving town soon, and whose
awareness that the affair would be short-lived would make her idealizing of
him all the more intense. Reality and long intimate exposure have a way of
dulling a person's perfection. The nineteenth-century poet Alfred de Musset was seduced by the writer George Sand, whose larger-than-life character appealed to his romantic nature. But when the couple visited Venice
together, and Sand came down with dysentery, she was suddenly no longer
an idealized figure but a woman with an unappealing physical problem. De
Musset himself showed a whiny, babyish side on this trip, and the lovers
separated. Once apart, however, they were able to idealize each other again,
and reunited a few months later. When reality intrudes, distance is often a
solution.
In politics the dangers are similar. Years after Kennedy's death, a string
of revelations (his incessant sexual affairs, his excessively dangerous
brinkmanship style of diplomacy, etc.) belied the myth he had created. His
image has survived this tarnishing; poll after poll shows that he is still
revered. Kennedy is a special case, perhaps, in that his assassination made
him a martyr, reinforcing the process of idealization that he had already set
in motion. But he is not the only example of an Ideal Lover whose attraction survives unpleasant revelations; these figures unleash such powerful
fantasies, and there is such a hunger for the myths and ideals they have to
sell, that they are often quickly forgiven. Still, it is always wise to be prudent, and to keep people from glimpsing the less-than-ideal side of your
character.

play. We are instantly attracted to those who are

They play with masculinity and femininity; they fashion their

The Masculine Dandy
n the 1870s, Pastor Henrik Gillot was the darling of the St. Petersburg
intelligentsia. He was young, handsome, well-read in philosophy and literature, and he preached a kind of enlightened Christianity. Dozens of
young girls had crushes on him and would flock to his sermons just to look
at him. In 1878, however, he met a girl who changed his life. Her name
was Lou von Salomé (later known as Lou Andreas-Salomé), and she was
seventeen; he was forty-two.
Salomé was pretty, with radiant blue eyes. She had read a lot, particularly for a girl her age, and was interested in the gravest philosophical and
religious issues. Her intensity, her intelligence, her responsiveness to ideas
cast a spell over Gillot. When she entered his office for her increasingly frequent discussions with him, the place seemed brighter and more alive. Perhaps she was flirting with him, in the unconscious manner of a young
girl—yet when Gillot admitted to himself that he was in love with her, and
proposed marriage, Salomé was horrified. The confused pastor never quite
got over Lou von Salomé, becoming the first of a long string of famous
men to be the victim of a lifelong unfulfilled infatuation with her.
In 1882, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was wandering
around Italy alone. In Genoa he received a letter from his friend Paul Rée,
a Prussian philosopher whom he admired, recounting his discussions with a
remarkable young Russian woman, Lou von Salomé, in Rome. Salomé was

The Art of Seduction

there on holiday with her mother; Rée had managed to accompany her on
long walks through the city, unchaperoned, and they had had many conversations. Her ideas on God and Christianity were quite similar to Nietzsche's, and when Rée had told her that the famous philosopher was a friend
of his, she had insisted that he invite Nietzsche to join them. In subsequent
letters Ree described how mysteriously captivating Salomé was, and how
anxious she was to meet Nietzsche. The philosopher soon went to Rome.
When Nietzsche finally met Salomé, he was overwhelmed. She had the
most beautiful eyes he had ever seen, and during their first long talk those
eyes lit up so intensely that he could not help feeling there was something
erotic about her excitement. Yet he was also confused: Salomé kept her distance, and did not respond to his compliments. What a devilish young
woman. A few days later she read him a poem of hers, and he cried; her
ideas about life were so like his own. Deciding to seize the moment, Nietzsche proposed marriage. (He did not know that Ree had done so as well.)
Salomé declined. She was interested in philosophy, life, adventure, not marriage. Undaunted, Nietzsche continued to court her. On an excursion to
Lake Orta with Rée, Salomé, and her mother, he managed to get the girl
alone, accompanying her on a walk up Monte Sacro while the others stayed
behind. Apparently the views and Nietzsche's words had the proper passionate effect; in a later letter to her, he described this walk as "the most
beautiful dream of my life." Now he was a man possessed: all he could
think about was marrying Salomé and having her all to himself.

embrace. Looking at you with her radiant blue eyes, she would say, 'The
reception of the semen is for me the height of ecstasy.' And she had an insatiable appetite for it. She was completely amoral . . . a vampire." The
Swedish psychotherapist Poul Bjerre, one of her later conquests, wrote, "I

towards him have been very
aptly expressed by
Aristophanes in the line:
"They long for him, they

The two emotions that almost every male felt in the presence of Lou
Andreas-Salomé were confusion and excitement—the two prerequisite
feelings for any successful seduction. People were intoxicated by her strange
mix of the masculine and the feminine; she was beautiful, with a radiant
smile and a graceful, flirtatious manner, but her independence and her intensely analytical nature made her seem oddly male. This ambiguity was
expressed in her eyes, which were both coquettish and probing. It was confusion that kept men interested and curious: no other woman was like this.
They wanted to know more. The excitement stemmed from her ability to
stir up repressed desires. She was a complete nonconformist, and to be involved with her was to break all kinds of taboos. Her masculinity made the

Keys to the Character

any of us today imagine that sexual freedom has progressed in recent
years—that everything has changed, for better or worse. This is
mostly an illusion; a reading of history reveals periods of licentiousness
(imperial Rome, late-seventeenth-century England, the "floating world" of
eighteenth-century Japan) far in excess of what we are currently experiencing. Gender roles are certainly changing, but they have changed before.
Society is in a state of constant flux, but there is something that does not
change: the vast majority of people conform to whatever is normal for the
time. They play the role allotted to them. Conformity is a constant because
humans are social creatures who are always imitating one another. At certain points in history it may be fashionable to be different and rebellious,

their disdain for convention: Théophile Gautier's red vest, Oscar Wilde's
green velvet suit, Andy Warhol's silver wigs. The great English Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli had two magnificent canes, one for morning, one
for evening; at noon he would change canes, no matter where he was. The
female Dandy works similarly. She may adopt male clothing, say, but if she
does, a touch here or there will set her truly apart: no man ever dressed
quite like George Sand. The overtall hat, the riding boots worn on the
streets of Paris, made her a sight to behold.
Remember, there must be a reference point. If your visual style is totally unfamiliar, people will think you at best an obvious attention-getter, at
worst crazy. Instead, create your own fashion sense by adapting and altering
prevailing styles to make yourself an object of fascination. Do this right and
you will be wildly imitated. The Count d'Orsay, a great London dandy of
the 1830s and 1840s, was closely watched by fashionable people; one day,
caught in a sudden London rainstorm, he bought a paltrok, a kind of heavy,
hooded duffle coat, off the back of a Dutch sailor. The paltrok immediately
became the coat to wear. Having people imitate you, of course, is a sign of
your powers of seduction.
The nonconformity of Dandies, however, goes far beyond appearances.
It is an attitude toward life that sets them apart; adopt that attitude and a
circle of followers will form around you.
Dandies are supremely impudent. They don't give a damn about other
people, and never try to please. In the court of Louis XIV, the writer La
Bruyere noticed that courtiers who tried hard to please were invariably on
the way down; nothing was more anti-seductive. As Barbey d'Aurevilly
wrote, "Dandies please women by displeasing them."
Impudence was fundamental to the appeal of Oscar Wilde. In a London theater one night, after the first performance of one of Wilde's plays,
the ecstatic audience yelled for the author to appear onstage. Wilde made
them wait and wait, then finally emerged, smoking a cigarette and wearing
an expression of total disdain. "It may be bad manners to appear here
smoking, but it is far worse to disturb me when I am smoking," he scolded
his fans. The Count d'Orsay was equally impudent. At a London club one
night, a Rothschild who was notoriously cheap accidentally dropped a gold
coin on the floor, then bent down to look for it. The count immediately
whipped out a thousand-franc note (worth much more than the coin),
rolled it up, lit it like a candle, and got down on all fours, as if to help light
the way in the search. Only a Dandy could get away with such audacity.
The insolence of the Rake is tied up with his desire to conquer a woman;
he cares for nothing else. The insolence of the Dandy, on the other hand, is
aimed at society and its conventions. It is not a woman he cares to conquer
but a whole group, an entire social world. And since people are generally
oppressed by the obligation of always being polite and self-sacrificing, they
are delighted to spend time around a person who disdains such niceties.
Dandies are masters of the art of living. They live for pleasure, not for
work; they surround themselves with beautiful objects and eat and drink

with the same relish they show for their clothes. This was how the great
Roman writer Petronius, author of the Satyricon, was able to seduce the
emperor Nero. Unlike the dull Seneca, the great Stoic thinker and Nero's
tutor, Petronius knew how to make every detail of life a grand aesthetic adventure, from a feast to a simple conversation. This is not an attitude you
should impose on those around you—you can't make yourself a nuisance—
but if you simply seem socially confident and sure of your taste, people will
be drawn to you. The key is to make everything an aesthetic choice. Your
ability to alleviate boredom by making life an art will make your company
highly prized.
The opposite sex is a strange country we can never know, and this excites us, creates the proper sexual tension. But it is also a source of annoyance and frustration. Men do not understand how women think, and vice
versa; each tries to make the other act more like a member of their own
sex. Dandies may never try to please, but in this one area they have a pleasing effect: by adopting psychological traits of the opposite sex, they appeal
to our inherent narcissism. Women identified with Rudolph Valentino's
delicacy and attention to detail in courtship; men identified with Lou
Andreas-Salomé's lack of interest in commitment. In the Heian court of
eleventh-century Japan, Sei Shonagon, the writer of The Pillow Book, was
powerfully seductive for men, especially literary types. She was fiercely independent, wrote poetry with the best, and had a certain emotional distance. Men wanted more from her than just to be her friend or companion,
as if she were another man; charmed by her empathy for male psychology,
they fell in love with her. This kind of mental transvestism—the ability to
enter the spirit of the opposite sex, adapt to their way of thinking, mirror
their tastes and attitudes—can be a key element in seduction. It is a way of
mesmerizing your victim.
According to Freud, the human libido is essentially bisexual; most people are in some way attracted to people of their own sex, but social constraints (varying with culture and historical period) repress these impulses.
The Dandy represents a release from such constraints. In several of Shakespeare's plays, a young girl (back then, the female roles in the theater were
actually played by male actors) has to go into disguise and dresses up as a
boy, eliciting all kinds of sexual interest from men, who later are delighted
to find out that the boy is actually a girl. (Think, for example, of Rosalind
in As You Like It.) Entertainers such as Josephine Baker (known as the
Chocolate Dandy) and Marlene Dietrich would dress up as men in their acts,
making themselves wildly popular—among men. Meanwhile the slightly
feminized male, the pretty boy, has always been seductive to women. Valentino embodied this quality. Elvis Presley had feminine features (the face, the
hips), wore frilly pink shirts and eye makeup, and attracted the attention of
women early on. The filmmaker Kenneth Anger said of Mick Jagger that it
was "a bisexual charm which constituted an important part of the attraction he had over young girls . . . and which acted upon their unconscious."
In Western culture for centuries, in fact, feminine beauty has been far more

The Dandy

fetishized than male beauty, so it is understandable that a feminine-looking
face like that of Montgomery Clift would have more seductive power than
that of John Wayne.
The Dandy figure has a place in politics as well. John F. Kennedy was a
strange mix of the masculine and feminine, virile in his toughness with the
Russians, and in his White House lawn football games, yet feminine in his
graceful and dapper appearance. This ambiguity was a large part of his appeal. Disraeli was an incorrigible Dandy in dress and manner; some were
suspicious of him as a result, but his courage in not caring what people
thought of him also won him respect. And women of course adored him,
for women always adore a Dandy. They appreciated the gentleness of his
manner, his aesthetic sense, his love of clothes—in other words, his feminine qualities. The mainstay of Disraeli's power was in fact a female fan:
Queen Victoria.
Do not be misled by the surface disapproval your Dandy pose may
elicit. Society may publicize its distrust of androgyny (in Christian theology, Satan is often represented as androgynous), but this conceals its
fascination; what is most seductive is often what is most repressed. Learn a
playful dandyism and you will become the magnet for people's dark, unrealized yearnings.
The key to such power is ambiguity. In a society where the roles everyone plays are obvious, the refusal to conform to any standard will excite interest. Be both masculine and feminine, impudent and charming, subtle
and outrageous. Let other people worry about being socially acceptable;
those types are a dime a dozen, and you are after a power greater than they
can imagine.

Dangers

T

he Dandy's strength, but also the Dandy's problem, is that he or she
often works through transgressive feelings relating to sex roles. Although this activity is highly charged and seductive, it is also dangerous,
since it touches on a source of great anxiety and insecurity. The greater
dangers will often come from your own sex. Valentino had immense appeal
for women, but men hated him. He was constantly dogged with accusations of being perversely unmasculine, and this caused him great pain. Salomé was equally disliked by women; Nietzsche's sister, and perhaps his
closest friend, considered her an evil witch, and led a virulent campaign
against her in the press long after the philosopher's death. There is little to
be done in the face of resentment like this. Some Dandies try to fight the
image they themselves have created, but this is unwise: to prove his masculinity, Valentino would engage in a boxing match, anything to prove his
masculinity. He wound up looking only desperate. Better to accept society's
occasional gibes with grace and insolence. After all, the Dandies' charm is
that they don't really care what people think of them. That is how Andy
Warhol played the game: when people tired of his antics or some scandal
erupted, instead of trying to defend himself he would simply move on to
some new image—decadent bohemian, high-society portraitist, etc.—as if
to say, with a hint of disdain, that the problem lay not with him but with
other people's attention span.

Another danger for the Dandy is the fact that insolence has its limits.
Beau Brummel prided himself on two things: his trimness of figure and his
acerbic wit. His main social patron was the Prince of Wales, who, in later
years, grew plump. One night at dinner, the prince rang for the butler, and
Brummel snidely remarked, "Do ring, Big Ben." The prince did not appreciate the joke, had Brummel shown out, and never spoke to him again.
Without royal patronage, Brummel fell into poverty and madness.
Even a Dandy, then, must measure out his impudence. A true Dandy
knows the difference between a theatrically staged teasing of the powerful
and a remark that will truly hurt, offend, or insult. It is particularly important to avoid insulting those in a position to injure you. In fact the pose
may work best for those who can afford to offend—artists, bohemians, etc.
In the work world, you will probably have to modify and tone down your
Dandy image. Be pleasantly different, an amusement, rather than a person
who challenges the group's conventions and makes others feel insecure.

Childhood is the golden paradise we
are always consciously or unconsciously trying to re-create. The Natural embodies the longedfor qualities of childhood—spontaneity, sincerity, unpretentiousness. In the presence of Naturals, we feel at ease,
caught up in their playful spirit, transported back to that
golden age. Naturals also make a virtue out of weakness, eliciting our sympathy for their trials, making us want to protect
them and help them. As with a child, much of this is natural, but some of it is exaggerated, a conscious seductive
maneuver.

adapt and build upon those childlike traits that they managed to preserve,
exactly as the child learns to play with its natural charm. This is the key. It
is within your power to do the same, since there is lurking within all of us a
devilish child straining to be let loose. To do this successfully, you have to
be able to let go to a degree, since there is nothing less natural than seeming
hesitant. Remember the spirit you once had; let it return, without selfconsciousness. People are much more forgiving of those who go all the
way, who seem uncontrollably foolish, than the halfhearted adult with a
childish streak. Remember who you were before you became so polite and
self-effacing. To assume the role of the Natural, mentally position yourself
in any relationship as the child, the younger one.
The following are the main types of the adult Natural. Keep in mind
that the greatest natural seducers are often a blend of more than one of
these qualities.

The innocent. The primary qualities of innocence are weakness and misunderstanding of the world. Innocence is weak because it is doomed to
vanish in a harsh, cruel world; the child cannot protect or hold on to its innocence. The misunderstandings come from the child's not knowing about
good and evil, and seeing everything through uncorrupted eyes. The weakness of children elicits sympathy, their misunderstandings make us laugh,
and nothing is more seductive than a mixture of laughter and sympathy.
The adult Natural is not truly innocent—it is impossible to grow up in
this world and retain total innocence. Yet Naturals yearn so deeply to hold
on to their innocent outlook that they manage to preserve the illusion of
innocence. They exaggerate their weakness to elicit the proper sympathy.
They act like they still see the world through innocent eyes, which in an
adult proves doubly humorous. Much of this is conscious, but to be effective, adult Naturals must make it seem subtle and effortless—if they are
seen as trying to act innocent, it will come across as pathetic. It is better for
them to communicate weakness indirectly, through looks and glances, or
through the situations they get themselves into, rather than anything obvious. Since this type of innocence is mostly an act, it is easily adaptable for
your own purposes. Learn to play up any natural weaknesses or flaws.

The imp. Impish children have a fearlessness that we adults have lost. That
is because they do not see the possible consequences of their actions—how
some people might be offended, how they might physically hurt themselves
in the process. Imps are brazen, blissfully uncaring. They infect you with
their lighthearted spirit. Such children have not yet had their natural energy
and spirit scolded out of them by the need to be polite and civil. Secretly,
we envy them; we want to be naughty too.
Adult imps are seductive because of how different they are from the rest
of us. Breaths of fresh air in a cautious world, they go full throttle, as if

The wonder. A wonder child has a special, inexplicable talent: a gift for
music, for mathematics, for chess, for sport. At work in the field in which
they have such prodigal skill, these children seem possessed, and their actions effortless. If they are artists or musicians, Mozart types, their work
seems to spring from some inborn impulse, requiring remarkably little
thought. If it is a physical talent that they have, they are blessed with unusual energy, dexterity, and spontaneity. In both cases they seem talented
beyond their years. This fascinates us.
Adult wonders are often former wonder children who have managed,
remarkably, to retain their youthful impulsiveness and improvisational skills.
True spontaneity is a delightful rarity, for everything in life conspires to rob
us of it—we have to learn to act carefully and deliberately, to think about
how we look in other people's eyes. To play the wonder you need some
skill that seems easy and natural, along with the ability to improvise. If in
fact your skill takes practice, you must hide this and learn to make your
work appear effortless. The more you hide the sweat behind what you do,
the more natural and seductive it will appear.

The undefensive lover. As people get older, they protect themselves against
painful experiences by closing themselves off. The price for this is that they
grow rigid, physically and mentally. But children are by nature unprotected
and open to experience, and this receptiveness is extremely attractive. In
the presence of children we become less rigid, infected with their openness. That is why we want to be around them.
Undefensive lovers have somehow circumvented the self-protective
process, retaining the playful, receptive spirit of the child. They often
manifest this spirit physically: they are graceful, and seem to age less rapidly
than other people. Of all the Natural's character qualities, this one is the
most useful. Defensiveness is deadly in seduction; act defensive and you'll
bring out defensiveness in other people. The undefensive lover, on the
other hand, lowers the inhibitions of his or her target, a critical part of seduction. It is important to learn to not react defensively: bend instead of
resist, be open to influence from others, and they will more easily fall under
your spell.

Examples of Natural Seducers

1. As a child growing up in England, Charlie Chaplin spent years in dire
poverty, particularly after his mother was committed to an asylum. In his
early teens, forced to work to live, he landed a job in vaudeville, eventually
gaining some success as a comedian. But Chaplin was wildly ambitious, and
so, in 1910, when he was only nineteen, he emigrated to the United States,
hoping to break into the film business. Making his way to Hollywood, he
found occasional bit parts, but success seemed elusive: the competition was
fierce, and although Chaplin had a repertoire of gags that he had learned in
vaudeville, he did not particularly excel at physical humor, a critical part of
silent comedy. He was not a gymnast like Buster Keaton.
In 1914, Chaplin managed to get the lead in a film short called Making
a Living. His role was that of a con artist. In playing around with the costume for the part, he put on a pair of pants several sizes too large, then
added a derby hat, enormous boots that he wore on the wrong feet, a walking cane, and a pasted-on mustache. With the clothes, a whole new character seemed to come to life—first the silly walk, then the twirling of the
cane, then all sorts of gags. Mack Sennett, the head of the studio, did not
find Making a Living very funny, and doubted whether Chaplin had a future
in the movies, but a few critics felt otherwise. A review in a trade magazine
read, "The clever player who takes the role of a nervy and very nifty
sharper in this picture is a comedian of the first water, who acts like one of
Nature's own naturals." And audiences also responded—the film made
money.
What seemed to touch a nerve in Making a Living, setting Chaplin apart
from the horde of other comedians working in silent film, was the almost

audiences sensed that the role Chaplin played came from somewhere deep
inside—that he was sincere, that he was actually playing himself. Within
a few years after Making a Living, Chaplin was the most famous actor
in the world. There were Chaplin dolls, comic books, toys; popular songs
and short stories were written about him; he became a universal icon. In
1921, when he returned to London for the first time since he had left it, he
was greeted by enormous crowds, as if at the triumphant return of a great
general.
The greatest seducers, those who seduce mass audiences, nations, the
world, have a way of playing on people's unconscious, making them react
in a way they can neither understand nor control. Chaplin inadvertently hit
on this power when he discovered the effect he could have on audiences by
playing up his weakness, by suggesting that he had a child's mind in an adult
body. In the early twentieth century, the world was radically and rapidly
changing. People were working longer and longer hours at increasingly
mechanical jobs; life was becoming steadily more inhuman and heartless, as
the ravages of World War I made clear. Caught in the midst of revolutionary change, people yearned for a lost childhood that they imagined as a
golden paradise.
An adult child like Chaplin has immense seductive power, for he offers
the illusion that life was once simpler and easier, and that for a moment, or
for as long as the movie lasts, you can win that life back. In a cruel, amoral
world, naivete has enormous appeal. The key is to bring it off with an air
of total seriousness, as the straight man does in stand-up comedy. More important, however, is the creation of sympathy. Overt strength and power is
rarely seductive—it makes us afraid, or envious. The royal road to seduction
is to play up your vulnerability and helplessness. You cannot make this obvious; to seem to be begging for sympathy is to seem needy, which is entirely anti-seductive. Do not proclaim yourself a victim or underdog, but
reveal it in your manner, in your confusion. A display of "natural" weakness will make you instantly lovable, both lowering people's defenses and
making them feel delightfully superior to you. Put yourself in situations
that make you seem weak, in which someone else has the advantage; they
are the bully, you are the innocent lamb. Without any effort on your part,
people will feel sympathy for you. Once people's eyes cloud over with
sentimental mist, they will not see how you are manipulating them.

2. Emma Crouch, born in 1842 in Plymouth, England, came from a respectable middle-class family. Her father was a composer and music professor who dreamed of success in the world of light opera. Among his many
children, Emma was his favorite: she was a delightful child, lively and flirtatious, with red hair and a freckled face. Her father doted on her, and promised her a brilliant future in the theater. Unfortunately Mr. Crouch had a

abandoned his family and left for America. The Crouches were now in dire
straits. Emma was told that her father had died in an accident and she was
sent off to a convent. The loss of her father affected her deeply, and as the
years went by she seemed lost in the past, acting as if he still doted on her.

edge. In 1864, she was to appear as Cupid in the Offenbach operetta Orpheus in the Underworld. Society was dying to see what she would do to
cause a sensation, and soon found out: she came on stage practically naked,
except for expensive diamonds here and there, barely covering her. As she
pranced on stage, the diamonds fell off, each one worth a fortune; she did
not stoop to pick them up, but let them roll off into the footlights. The
gentlemen in the audience, some of whom had given her those diamonds,
applauded her wildly. Antics like this made Cora the toast of Paris, and she
reigned as the city's supreme courtesan for over a decade, until the FrancoPrussian War of 1870 put an end to the Second Empire.
People often mistakenly believe that what makes a person desirable and seductive is physical beauty, elegance, or overt sexuality. Yet Cora Pearl was
not dramatically beautiful; her body was boyish, and her style was garish
and tasteless. Even so, the most dashing men of Europe vied for her favors,
often ruining themselves in the process. It was Cora's spirit and attitude that
enthralled them. Spoiled by her father, she imagined that spoiling her was
natural—that all men should do the same. The consequence was that, like a
child, she never felt she had to try to please. It was Cora's powerful air of
independence that made men want to possess her, tame her. She never pretended to be anything more than a courtesan, so the brazenness that in a
lady would have been uncivil in her seemed natural and fun. And as with a
spoiled child, a man's relationship with her was on her terms. The moment
he tried to change that, she lost interest. This was the secret of her astounding success.
Spoiled children have an undeservedly bad reputation: while those who
are spoiled with material things are indeed often insufferable, those who are
spoiled with affection know themselves to be deeply seductive. This becomes a distinct advantage when they grow up. According to Freud (who
was speaking from experience, since he was his mother's darling), spoiled
children have a confidence that stays with them all their lives. This quality
radiates outward, drawing others to them, and, in a circular process, making
people spoil them still more. Since their spirit and natural energy were
never tamed by a disciplining parent, as adults they are adventurous and
bold, and often impish or brazen.
The lesson is simple: it may be too late to be spoiled by a parent, but it
is never too late to make other people spoil you. It is all in your attitude.
People are drawn to those who expect a lot out of life, whereas they tend
to disrespect those who are fearful and undemanding. Wild independence
has a provocative effect on us: it appeals to us, while also presenting us with
a challenge—we want to be the one to tame it, to make the spirited person
dependent on us. Half of seduction is stirring such competitive desires.

3. In October of 1925, Paris society was all excited about the opening of
the Revue Negre. Jazz, or in fact anything that came from black America,

was the latest fashion, and the Broadway dancers and performers who made
up the Revue Nègre were African-American. On opening night, artists
and high society packed the hall. The show was spectacular, as they expected, but nothing prepared them for the last number, performed by a
somewhat gawky long-legged woman with the prettiest face: Josephine
Baker, a twenty-year-old chorus girl from East St. Louis. She came onstage
bare-breasted, wearing a skirt of feathers over a satin bikini bottom, with
feathers around her neck and ankles. Although she performed her number,
called "Danse Sauvage," with another dancer, also clad in feathers, all eyes
were riveted on her: her whole body seemed to come alive in a way the audience had never seen before, her legs moving with the litheness of a cat,
her rear end gyrating in patterns that one critic likened to a hummingbird's.
As the dance went on, she seemed possessed, feeding off the crowd's ecstatic reaction. And then there was the look on her face: she was having such
fun. She radiated a joy that made her erotic dance oddly innocent, even
slightly comic.
By the following day, word had spread: a star was born. Josephine became the heart of the Revue Nègre, and Paris was at her feet. Within a
year, her face was on posters everywhere; there were Josephine Baker perfumes, dolls, clothes; fashionable Frenchwomen were slicking their hair
back a la Baker, using a product called Bakerfix. They were even trying to
darken their skin.
Such sudden fame represented quite a change, for just a few years earlier, Josephine had been a young girl growing up in East St. Louis, one of
America's worst slums. She had gone to work at the age of eight, cleaning
houses for a white woman who beat her. She had sometimes slept in a ratinfested basement; there had never been heat in the winter. (She had taught
herself to dance in her wild fashion to help keep herself warm.) In 1919,
Josephine had run away and become a part-time vaudeville performer,
landing in New York two years later without money or connections. She
had had some success as a clowning chorus girl, providing comic relief with
her crossed eyes and screwed-up face, but she hadn't stood out. Then she
was invited to Paris. Some other black performers had declined, fearing
things might be still worse for them in France than in America, but
Josephine jumped at the chance.
Despite her success with the Revue Nègre, Josephine did not delude
herself: Parisians were notoriously fickle. She decided to turn the relationship around. First, she refused to be aligned with any club, and developed a
reputation for breaking contracts at will, making it clear that she was ready
to leave in an instant. Since childhood she had been afraid of dependence
on anyone; now no one could take her for granted. This only made impresarios chase her and the public appreciate her the more. Second, she was
aware that although black culture had become the vogue, what the French
had fallen in love with was a kind of caricature. If that was what it took
to be successful, so be it, but Josephine made it clear that she did not take
the caricature seriously; instead she reversed it, becoming the ultimate

The Natural •

Frenchwoman of fashion, a caricature not of blackness but of whiteness.
Everything was a role to play—the comedienne, the primitive dancer, the
ultrastylish Parisian. And everything Josephine did, she did with such a light
spirit, such a lack of pretension, that she continued to seduce the jaded
French for years. Her funeral, in 1975, was nationally televised, a huge cultural event. She was buried with the kind of pomp normally reserved only
for heads of state.
From very early on, Josephine Baker could not stand the feeling of having
no control over the world. Yet what could she do in the face of her unpromising circumstances? Some young girls put all their hopes on a husband, but Josephine's father had left her mother soon after she was born,
and she saw marriage as something that would only make her more miserable. Her solution was something children often do: confronted with a
hopeless environment, she closed herself off in a world of her own making,
oblivious to the ugliness around her. This world was filled with dancing,
clowning, dreams of great things. Let other people wail and moan; Josephine would smile, remain confident and self-reliant. Almost everyone who
met her, from her earliest years to her last, commented on how seductive
this quality was. Her refusal to compromise, or to be what she was expected
to be, made everything she did seem authentic and natural.
A child loves to play, and to create a little self-contained world. When
children are absorbed in make believe, they are hopelessly charming. They
infuse their imaginings with such seriousness and feeling. Adult Naturals do
something similar, particularly if they are artists: they create their own fantasy world, and live in it as if it were the real one. Fantasy is so much more
pleasant than reality, and since most people do not have the power or
courage to create such a world, they enjoy being around those who do. Remember: the role you were given in life is not the role you have to accept.
You can always live out a role of your own creation, a role that fits your
fantasy. Learn to play with your image, never taking it too seriously. The
key is to infuse your play with the conviction and feeling of a child, making
it seem natural. The more absorbed you seem in your own joy-filled world,
the more seductive you become. Do not go halfway: make the fantasy you
inhabit as radical and exotic as possible, and you will attract attention like a
magnet.

4. It was the Festival of the Cherry Blossom at the Heian court, in latetenth-century Japan. In the emperor's palace, many of the courtiers were
drunk, and others were fast asleep, but the young princess Oborozukiyo,
the emperor's sister-in-law, was awake and reciting a poem: "What can
compare with a misty moon of spring?" Her voice was smooth and delicate. She moved to the door of her apartment to look at the moon. Then,
suddenly, she smelled something sweet, and a hand clutched the sleeve of
her robe. "Who are you?" she said, frightened. "There is nothing to be

63

The Art of Seduction

afraid of," came a man's voice, and continued with a poem of his own:
"Late in the night we enjoy a misty moon. There is nothing misty about
the bond between us." Without another word, the man pulled the princess
to him and picked her up, carrying her into a gallery outside her room,
sliding the door closed behind him. She was terrified, and tried to call for
help. In the darkness she heard him say, a little louder now, "It will do you
no good. I am always allowed my way. Just be quiet, if you will, please."
Now the princess recognized the voice, and the scent: it was Genji, the
young son of the late emperor's concubine, whose robes bore a distinctive
perfume. This calmed her somewhat, since the man was someone she
knew, but on the other hand she also knew of his reputation: Genji was the
court's most incorrigible seducer, a man who stopped at nothing. He was
drunk, it was near dawn, and the watchmen would soon be on their
rounds; she did not want to be discovered with him. But then she began to
make out the outlines of his face—so pretty, his look so sincere, without a
trace of malice. Then came more poems, recited in that charming voice,
the words so insinuating. The images he conjured filled her mind, and distracted her from his hands. She could not resist him.
As the light began to rise, Genji got to his feet. He said a few tender
words, they exchanged fans, and then he quickly left. The serving women
were coming through the emperor's rooms by now, and when they saw
Genji scurrying away, the perfume of his robes lingering after him, they
smiled, knowing he was up to his usual tricks; but they never imagined he
would dare approach the sister of the emperor's wife.
In the days that followed, Oborozukiyo could only think of Genji. She
knew he had other mistresses, but when she tried to put him out of her
mind, a letter from him would arrive, and she would be back to square one.
In truth, she had started the correspondence, haunted by his midnight visit.
She had to see him again. Despite the risk of discovery, and the fact that
her sister Kokiden, the emperor's wife, hated Genji, she arranged for further trysts in her apartment. But one night an envious courtier found them
together. Word reached Kokiden, who naturally was furious. She demanded that Genji be banished from court and the emperor had no choice
but to agree.
Genji went far away, and things settled down. Then the emperor died
and his son took over. A kind of emptiness had come to the court: the
dozens of women whom Genji had seduced could not endure his absence,
and flooded him with letters. Even women who had never known him intimately would weep over any relic he had left behind—a robe, for instance, in which his scent still lingered. And the young emperor missed his
jocular presence. And the princesses missed the music he had played on the
koto. And Oborozukiyo pined for his midnight visits. Finally even Kokiden
broke down, realizing that she could not resist him. So Genji was summoned back to the court. And not only was he forgiven, he was given a
hero's welcome; the young emperor himself greeted the scoundrel with
tears in his eyes.

The Natural •

The story of Genji's life is told in the eleventh-century novel The Tale of
Genji, written by Murasaki Shikibu, a woman of the Heian court. The
character was most likely based on a real-life man, Fujiwara no Korechika.
Indeed another book of the period, The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon, describes an encounter between the female author and Korechika, and reveals
his incredible charm and his almost hypnotic effect on women. Genji is a
Natural, an undefensive lover, a man who has a lifelong obsession with
women but whose appreciation of and affection for them makes him irresistible. As he says to Oborozukiyo in the novel, "I am always allowed my
way." This self-belief is half of Genji's charm. Resistance does not make
him defensive; he retreats gracefully, reciting a little poetry, and as he leaves,
the perfume of his robes trailing behind him, his victim wonders why she
has been so afraid, and what she is missing by spurning him, and she finds a
way to let him know that the next time things will be different. Genji takes
nothing seriously or personally, and at the age of forty, an age at which
most men of the eleventh century were already looking old and worn, he
still seems like a boy. His seductive powers never leave him.
Human beings are immensely suggestible; their moods will easily spread
to the people around them. In fact seduction depends on mimesis, on the
conscious creation of a mood or feeling that is then reproduced by the
other person. But hesitation and awkwardness are also contagious, and
are deadly to seduction. If in a key moment you seem indecisive or selfconscious, the other person will sense that you are thinking of yourself, instead of being overwhelmed by his or her charms. The spell will be broken.
As an undefensive lover, though, you produce the opposite effect: your victim might be hesitant or worried, but confronted with someone so sure and
natural, he or she will be caught up in the mood. Like dancing with someone you lead effortlessly across the dance floor, it is a skill you can learn. It
is a matter of rooting out the fear and awkwardness that have built up in
you over the years, of becoming more graceful with your approach, less defensive when others seem to resist. Often people's resistance is a way of
testing you, and if you show any awkwardness or hesitation, you not only
will fail the test, but you will risk infecting them with your doubts.

66 • The Art of Seduction

Dangers
childish quality can be charming but it can also be irritating; the innocent have no experience of the world, and their sweetness can prove
cloying. In Milan Kundera's novel The Book of Laughter and Forgetting, the
hero dreams that he is trapped on an island with a group of children. Soon
their wonderful qualities become intensely annoying to him; after a few
days of exposure to them he cannot relate to them at all. The dream turns
into a nightmare, and he longs to be back among adults, with real things to
do and talk about. Because total childishness can quickly grate, the most seductive Naturals are those who, like Josephine Baker, combine adult experience and wisdom with a childlike manner. It is this mixture of qualities
that is most alluring.
Society cannot tolerate too many Naturals. Given a crowd of Cora
Pearls or Charlie Chaplins, their charm would quickly wear off. In any case
it is usually only artists, or people with abundant leisure time, who can afford to go all the way. The best way to use the Natural character type is in
specific situations when a touch of innocence or impishness will help lower
your target's defenses. A con man plays dumb to make the other person
trust him and feel superior. This kind of feigned naturalness has countless
applications in daily life, where nothing is more dangerous than looking
smarter than the next person; the Natural pose is the perfect way to disguise
your cleverness. But if you are uncontrollably childish and cannot turn it
off, you run the risk of seeming pathetic, earning not sympathy but pity
and disgust.
Similarly, the seductive traits of the Natural work best in one who is
still young enough for them to seem natural. They are much harder for an
older person to pull off. Cora Pearl did not seem so charming when she
was still wearing her pink flouncy dresses in her fifties. The Duke of Buckingham, who seduced everyone in the English court in the 1620s (including the homosexual King James I himself), was wondrously childish in
looks and manner; but this became obnoxious and off-putting as he grew
older, and he eventually made enough enemies that he ended up being murdered. As you age, then, your natural qualities should suggest more the
child's open spirit, less an innocence that will no longer convince anyone.

The
ability to delay satisfaction is
the ultimate art of seduction—while
waiting, the victim is held in thrall. Coquettes
are the grand masters of this game, orchestrating a
back-and-forth movement between hope and frustration.
They bait with the promise of reward—the hope of physical
pleasure, happiness, fame by association, power—all of which,
however, proves elusive; yet this only makes their targets pursue
them the more. Coquettes seem totally self-sufficient: they do
not need you, they seem to say, and their narcissism proves devilishly attractive. You want to conquer them but they hold the cards.
The strategy of the Coquette is never to offer total satisfaction.

The Hot and Cold Coquette

I

n the autumn of 1795, Paris was caught up in a strange giddiness. The
Reign of Terror that had followed the French Revolution had ended; the
sound of the guillotine was gone. The city breathed a collective sigh of relief, and gave way to wild parties and endless festivals.
The young Napoleon Bonaparte, twenty-six at the time, had no interest in such revelries. He had made a name for himself as a bright, audacious

During the French Revolution, Josephine had come within minutes of losing her head on the guillotine. The experience left her without illusions,
and with two goals in mind: to live a life of pleasure, and to find the man
who could best supply it. She set her sights on Napoleon early on. He was
young, and had a brilliant future. Beneath his calm exterior, Josephine
sensed, he was highly emotional and aggressive, but this did not intimidate
her—it only revealed his insecurity and weakness. He would be easy to enslave. First, Josephine adapted to his moods, charmed him with her feminine grace, warmed him with her looks and manner. He wanted to possess
her. And once she had aroused this desire, her power lay in postponing its
satisfaction, withdrawing from him, frustrating him. In fact the torture of

The Cold Coquette
n 1952, the writer Truman Capote, a recent success in literary and social
circles, began to receive an almost daily barrage of fan mail from a young
man named Andy Warhol. An illustrator for shoe designers, fashion magazines, and the like, Warhol made pretty, stylized drawings, some of which
he sent to Capote, hoping the author would include them in one of his
books. Capote did not respond. One day he came home to find Warhol
talking to his mother, with whom Capote lived. And Warhol began to telephone almost daily. Finally Capote put an end to all this: "He seemed one
of those hopeless people that you just know nothing's ever going to happen
to. Just a hopeless, born loser," the writer later said.
Ten years later, Andy Warhol, aspiring artist, had his first one-man
show at the Stable Gallery in Manhattan. On the walls were a series of
silkscreened paintings based on the Campbell's soup can and the Coca-Cola
bottle. At the opening and at the party afterward, Warhol stood to the side,
staring blankly, talking little. What a contrast he was to the older generation
of artists, the abstract expressionists—mostly hard-drinking womanizers full
of bluster and aggression, big talkers who had dominated the art scene for
the previous fifteen years. And what a change from the Warhol who had

baffled and intrigued by the coldness of Warhol's work; they could not figure out how the artist felt about his subjects. What was his position? What
was he trying to say? When they asked, he would simply reply, "I just do it
because I like it," or, "I love soup." The critics went wild with their interpretations: "An art like Warhol's is necessarily parasitic upon the myths of
its time," one wrote; another, "The decision not to decide is a paradox that
is equal to an idea which expresses nothing but then gives it dimension."
The show was a huge success, establishing Warhol as a leading figure in a
new movement, pop art.
In 1963, Warhol rented a large Manhattan loft space that he called the
Factory, and that soon became the hub of a large entourage—hangers-on,
actors, aspiring artists. Here, particularly at night, Warhol would simply
wander about, or stand in a corner. People would gather around him, fight
for his attention, throw questions at him, and he would answer, in his noncommittal way. But no one could get close to him, physically or mentally;
he would not allow it. At the same time, if he walked by you without giving you his usual "Oh, hi," you were devastated. He hadn't noticed you;
perhaps you were on the way out.
Increasingly interested in filmmaking, Warhol cast his friends in his
movies. In effect he was offering them a kind of instant celebrity (their
"fifteen minutes of fame"—the phrase is Warhol's). Soon people were
competing for roles. He groomed women in particular for stardom: Edie
Sedgwick, Viva, Nico. Just being around him offered a kind of celebrity by
association. The Factory became the place to be seen, and stars like Judy
Garland and Tennessee Williams would go to parties there, rubbing elbows
with Sedgwick, Viva, and the bohemian lower echelons whom Warhol had
befriended. People began sending limos to bring him to parties of their
own; his presence alone was enough to turn a social evening into a scene—
even though he would pass through in near silence, keeping to himself and
leaving early.
In 1967, Warhol was asked to lecture at various colleges. He hated to
talk, particularly about his own art; "The less something has to say," he felt,
"the more perfect it is." But the money was good and Warhol always found
it hard to say no. His solution was simple: he asked an actor, Allen
Midgette, to impersonate him. Midgette was dark-haired, tan, part Cherokee Indian. He did not resemble Warhol in the least. But Warhol and
friends covered his face with powder, sprayed his brown hair silver, gave
him dark glasses, and dressed him in Warhol's clothes. Since Midgette knew
nothing about art, his answers to students' questions tended to be as short
and enigmatic as Warhol's own. The impersonation worked. Warhol may
have been an icon, but no one really knew him, and since he often wore
dark glasses, even his face was unfamiliar in any detail. The lecture audiences were far enough away to be teased by the thought of his presence,
and no one got close enough to catch the deception. He remained elusive.

The Coquette • 73

Early on in life, Andy Warhol was plagued by conflicting emotions: he desperately wanted fame, but he was naturally passive and shy "I've always had
a conflict," he later said, "because I'm shy and yet I like to take up a lot of
personal space. Mom always said, 'Don't be pushy, but let everyone know
you're around.' " At first Warhol tried to make himself more aggressive,
straining to please and court. It didn't work. After ten futile years he
stopped trying and gave in to his own passivity—only to discover the power
that withdrawal commands.
Warhol began this process in his artwork, which changed dramatically
in the early 1960s. His new paintings of soup cans, green stamps, and other
widely known images did not assault you with meaning; in fact their meaning was totally elusive, which only heightened their fascination. They drew
you in by their immediacy, their visual power, their coldness. Having transformed his art, Warhol also transformed himself: like his paintings, he became pure surface. He trained himself to hold himself back, to stop talking.
The world is full of people who try, people who impose themselves aggressively. They may gain temporary victories, but the longer they are
around, the more people want to confound them. They leave no space
around themselves, and without space there can be no seduction. Cold Coquettes create space by remaining elusive and making others pursue them.
Their coolness suggests a comfortable confidence that is exciting to be
around, even though it may not actually exist; their silence makes you want
to talk. Their self-containment, their appearance of having no need for
other people, only makes us want to do things for them, hungry for the
slightest sign of recognition and favor. Cold Coquettes may be maddening
to deal with—never committing but never saying no, never allowing closeness—but more often than not we find ourselves coming back to them, addicted to the coldness they project. Remember: seduction is a process of
drawing people in, making them want to pursue and possess you. Seem distant and people will go mad to win your favor. Humans, like nature, hate a
vacuum, and emotional distance and silence make them strain to fill up the
empty space with words and heat of their own. Like Warhol, stand back
and let them fight over you.

Keys to the Character

ccording to the popular concept, Coquettes are consummate teases,
experts at arousing desire through a provocative appearance or an alluring attitude. But the real essence of Coquettes is in fact their ability to
trap people emotionally, and to keep their victims in their clutches long after that first titillation of desire. This is the skill that puts them in the ranks

to please her when she was angry or upset. Her tears had a similar effect:
what had he done, why was she so sad? He eventually ruined himself and
his kingdom trying to keep her happy. Tears, anger, and the production of
guilt are all the tools of the Coquette. A similar dynamic appears in a lover's
quarrel: when a couple fights, then reconciles, the joys of reconciliation
only make the attachment stronger. Sadness of any sort is also seductive,
particularly if it seems deep-rooted, even spiritual, rather than needy or
pathetic—it makes people come to you.
Coquettes are never jealous—that would undermine their image of
fundamental self-sufficiency. But they are masters at inciting jealousy: by
paying attention to a third party, creating a triangle of desire, they signal to
their victims that they may not be that interested. This triangulation is extremely seductive, in social contexts as well as erotic ones. Interested in narcissistic women, Freud was a narcissist himself, and his aloofness drove his
disciples crazy. (They even had a name for it—his "god complex.") Behaving like a kind of messiah, too lofty for petty emotions, Freud always maintained a distance between himself and his students, hardly ever inviting
them over for dinner, say, and keeping his private life shrouded in mystery.
Yet he would occasionally choose an acolyte to confide in—Carl Jung,
Otto Rank, Lou Andreas-Salomé. The result was that his disciples went
berserk trying to win his favor, to be the one he chose. Their jealousy
when he suddenly favored one of them only increased his power over
them. People's natural insecurities are heightened in group settings; by

maintaining aloofness, Coquettes start a competition to win their favor. If
the ability to use third parties to make targets jealous is a critical seductive
skill, Sigmund Freud was a grand Coquette.
All of the tactics of the Coquette have been adapted by political leaders
to make the public fall in love. While exciting the masses, these leaders remain inwardly detached, which keeps them in control. The political scientist
Roberto Michels has even referred to such politicians as Cold Coquettes.
Napoleon played the Coquette with the French: after the grand successes of
the Italian campaign had made him a beloved hero, he left France to conquer Egypt, knowing that in his absence the government would fall apart,
the people would hunger for his return, and their love would serve as the
base for an expansion of his power. After exciting the masses with a rousing
speech, Mao Zedong would disappear from sight for days on end, making
himself an object of cultish worship. And no one was more of a Coquette
than Yugoslav leader Josef Tito, who alternated between distance from and
emotional identification with his people. All of these political leaders were
confirmed narcissists. In times of trouble, when people feel insecure, the effect of such political coquetry is even more powerful. It is important to realize that coquetry is extremely effective on a group, stimulating jealousy, love,
and intense devotion. If you play such a role with a group, remember to
keep an emotional and physical distance. This will allow you to cry and
laugh on command, project self-sufficiency, and with such detachment you
will be able play people's emotions like a piano.

Dangers
oquettes face an obvious danger: they play with volatile emotions.
Every time the pendulum swings, love shifts to hate. So they must orchestrate everything carefully. Their absences cannot be too long, their
bouts of anger must be quickly followed by smiles. Coquettes can keep
their victims emotionally entrapped for a long time, but over months or
years the dynamic can begin to prove tiresome. Jiang Qing, later known as
Madame Mao, used coquettish skills to capture the heart of Mao Tse-tung,
but after ten years the quarreling, the tears and the coolness became intensely irritating, and once irritation proved stronger than love, Mao was
able to detach. Josephine, a more brilliant Coquette, was able to adapt, by
spending a whole year without playing coy or withdrawing from Napoleon.
Timing is everything. On the other hand, though, the Coquette stirs up
powerful emotions, and breakups often prove temporary. The Coquette is
addictive: after the failure of the social plan Mao called the Great Leap Forward, Madame Mao was able to reestablish her power over her devastated
husband.
The Cold Coquette can stimulate a particularly deep hatred. Valerie
Solanas was a young woman who fell under Andy Warhol's spell. She had
written a play that amused him, and she was given the impression he might
turn it into a film. She imagined becoming a celebrity. She also got involved in the feminist movement, and when, in June 1968, it dawned on
her that Warhol was toying with her, she directed her growing rage at men
on him and shot him three times, nearly killing him. Cold Coquettes may
stimulate feelings that are not so much erotic as intellectual, less passion and
more fascination. The hatred they can stir up is all the more insidious and
dangerous, for it may not be counterbalanced by a deep love. They must
realize the limits of the game, and the disturbing effects they can have on
less stable people.

Charm is seduction without sex. Charmers are consummate manipulators,
masking their cleverness by creating a mood of pleasure and comfort. Their
method is simple: they deflect attention from themselves and focus it on their
target. They understand your spirit, feel your pain, adapt to your moods.

exuality is extremely disruptive. The insecurities and emotions it stirs
up can often cut short a relationship that would otherwise be deeper

illusory)—but subtract the sex itself. It's not that the Charmer represses Birds are taken with pipes

whom you are addressing.

school. This is the way to

need not care what you say,
and had better not be
sensible. They, too, will
rally you on many points,

Be a source of pleasure. No one wants to hear about your problems and
troubles. Listen to your targets' complaints, but more important, distract
them from their problems by giving them pleasure. (Do this often enough
and they will fall under your spell.) Being lighthearted and fun is always
more charming than being serious and critical. An energetic presence is
likewise more charming than lethargy, which hints at boredom, an enormous social taboo; and elegance and style will usually win out over vulgarity, since most people like to associate themselves with whatever they
think elevated and cultured. In politics, provide illusion and myth rather
than reality. Instead of asking people to sacrifice for the greater good, talk
of grand moral issues. An appeal that makes people feel good will translate
into votes and power.

Bring antagonism into harmony. The court is a cauldron of resentment
and envy, where the sourness of a single brooding Cassius can quickly turn
into a conspiracy. The Charmer knows how to smooth out conflict. Never
stir up antagonisms that will prove immune to your charm; in the face of
those who are aggressive, retreat, let them have their little victories. Yielding and indulgence will charm the fight out of any potential enemies.
Never criticize people overtly—that will make them insecure, and resistant
to change. Plant ideas, insinuate suggestions. Charmed by your diplomatic
skills, people will not notice your growing power.

Lull your victims into ease and comfort. Charm is like the hypnotist's
trick with the swinging watch: the more relaxed the target, the easier it is
to bend him or her to your will. The key to making your victims feel comfortable is to mirror them, adapt to their moods. People are narcissists—
they are drawn to those most similar to themselves. Seem to share their
values and tastes, to understand their spirit, and they will fall under your
spell. This works particularly well if you are an outsider: showing that you
share the values of your adopted group or country (you have learned their
language, you prefer their customs, etc.) is immensely charming, since for
you this preference is a choice, not a question of birth. Never pester or be
overly persistent—these uncharming qualities will disrupt the relaxation
you need to cast your spell.

The Charmer •

Show calm and self-possession in the face of adversity. Adversity and
setbacks actually provide the perfect setting for charm. Showing a calm, unruffled exterior in the face of unpleasantness puts people at ease. You seem
patient, as if waiting for destiny to deal you a better card—or as if you were
confident you could charm the Fates themselves. Never show anger, ill
temper, or vengefulness, all disruptive emotions that will make people defensive. In the politics of large groups, welcome adversity as a chance to
show the charming qualities of magnanimity and poise. Let others get flustered and upset—the contrast will redound to your favor. Never whine,
never complain, never try to justify yourself.

Make yourself useful. If done subtly, your ability to enhance the lives of
others will be devilishly seductive. Your social skills will prove important
here: creating a wide network of allies will give you the power to link
people up with each other, which will make them feel that by knowing
you they can make their lives easier. This is something no one can resist.
Follow-through is key: so many people will charm by promising a person
great things—a better job, a new contact, a big favor—but if they do not
follow through they make enemies instead of friends. Anyone can make a
promise; what sets you apart, and makes you charming, is your ability to
come through in the end, following up your promise with a definite action.
Conversely, if someone does you a favor, show your gratitude concretely.
In a world of bluff and smoke, real action and true helpfulness are perhaps
the ultimate charm.

Examples of Charmers
1. In the early 1870s, Queen Victoria of England had reached a low point
in her life. Her beloved husband, Prince Albert, had died in 1861, leaving
her more than grief stricken. In all of her decisions she had relied on his
advice; she was too uneducated and inexperienced to do otherwise, or so
everyone made her feel. In fact, with Albert's death, political discussions
and policy issues had come to bore her to tears. Now Victoria gradually
withdrew from the public eye. As a result, the monarchy became less popular and therefore less powerful.
In 1874, the Conservative Party came to power, and its leader, the
seventy-year-old Benjamin Disraeli, became prime minister. The protocol
of his accession to his seat demanded that he come to the palace for a private meeting with the queen, who was fifty-five at the time. Two more unlikely associates could not be imagined: Disraeli, who was Jewish by birth,
had dark skin and exotic features by English standards; as a young man he
had been a dandy, his dress bordering on the flamboyant, and he had written popular novels that were romantic or even Gothic in style. The queen,
on the other hand, was dour and stubborn, formal in manner and simple in

taste. To please her, Disraeli was advised, he should curb his natural elegance; but he disregarded what everyone had told him and appeared before
her as a gallant prince, falling to one knee, taking her hand, and kissing it,
saying, "I plight my troth to the kindest of mistresses." Disraeli pledged that
his work now was to realize Victoria's dreams. He praised her qualities so
fulsomely that she blushed; yet strangely enough, she did not find him
comical or offensive, but came out of the encounter smiling. Perhaps she
should give this strange man a chance, she thought, and she waited to see
what he would do next.
Victoria soon began receiving reports from Disraeli—on parliamentary
debates, policy issues, and so forth—that were unlike anything other ministers had written. Addressing her as the "Faery Queen," and giving the

notes with gossip. In a note about a new cabinet member, Disraeli wrote,

At the start of their relationship, Disraeli sent the queen all of his novels
as a gift. She in return presented him with the one book she had written,

Journal of Our Life in the Highlands. From then on he would toss out in his

letters and conversations with her the phrase, "We authors." The queen
would beam with pride. She would overhear him praising her to others—
her ideas, common sense, and feminine instincts, he said, made her the
equal of Elizabeth I. He rarely disagreed with her. At meetings with other
ministers, he would suddenly turn and ask her for advice. In 1875, when
Disraeli managed to finagle the purchase of the Suez Canal from the debtridden khedive of Egypt, he presented his accomplishment to the queen as
if it were a realization of her own ideas about expanding the British Empire. She did not realize the cause, but her confidence was growing by leaps
and bounds.
Victoria once sent flowers to her prime minister. He later returned the
favor, sending primroses, a flower so ordinary that some recipients might
have been insulted; but his gift came with a note: "Of all the flowers, the
one that retains its beauty longest, is sweet primrose." Disraeli was enveloping Victoria in a fantasy atmosphere in which everything was a metaphor,
and the simplicity of the flower of course symbolized the queen—and also
the relationship between the two leaders. Victoria fell for the bait; primroses were soon her favorite flower. In fact everything Disraeli did now met
with her approval. She allowed him to sit in her presence, an unheardof privilege. The two began to exchange valentines every February. The
queen would ask people what Disraeli had said at a party; when he paid a
little too much attention to Empress Augusta of Germany, she grew jealous. The courtiers wondered what had happened to the stubborn, formal
woman they had known—she was acting like an infatuated girl.

The Charmer •

In 1876, Disraeli steered through Parliament a bill declaring Queen
Victoria a "Queen-Empress." The queen was beside herself with joy. Out
of gratitude and certainly love, she elevated this Jewish dandy and novelist
to the peerage, making him Earl of Beaconsfield, the realization of a lifelong dream.
Disraeli knew how deceptive appearances can be: people were always judging him by his face and by his clothes, and he had learned never to do
the same to them. So he was not deceived by Queen Victoria's dour, sober
exterior. Beneath it, he sensed, was a woman who yearned for a man to
appeal to her feminine side, a woman who was affectionate, warm, even
sexual. The extent to which this side of Victoria had been repressed merely
revealed the strength of the feelings he would stir once he melted her
reserve.
Disraeli's approach was to appeal to two aspects of Victoria's personality
that other people had squashed: her confidence and her sexuality. He was a
master at flattering a person's ego. As one English princess remarked,
"When I left the dining room after sitting next to Mr. Gladstone, I thought
he was the cleverest man in England. But after sitting next to Mr. Disraeli, I
thought I was the cleverest woman in England." Disraeli worked his magic
with a delicate touch, insinuating an atmosphere of amusement and relaxation, particularly in relation to politics. Once the queen's guard was down,
he made that mood a little warmer, a little more suggestive, subtly sexual—
though of course without overt flirtation. Disraeli made Victoria feel desirable as a woman and gifted as a monarch. How could she resist? How could
she deny him anything?
Our personalities are often molded by how we are treated: if a parent or
spouse is defensive or argumentative in dealing with us, we tend to respond
the same way. Never mistake people's exterior characteristics for reality, for
the character they show on the surface may be merely a reflection of the
people with whom they have been most in contact, or a front disguising
its own opposite. A gruff exterior may hide a person dying for warmth; a
repressed, sober-looking type may actually be struggling to conceal uncontrollable emotions. That is the key to charm—feeding what has been
repressed or denied.
By indulging the queen, by making himself a source of pleasure, Disraeli was able to soften a woman who had grown hard and cantankerous.
Indulgence is a powerful tool of seduction: it is hard to be angry or defensive with someone who seems to agree with your opinions and tastes.
Charmers may appear to be weaker than their targets but in the end they
are the more powerful side because they have stolen the ability to resist.

2. In 1971, the American financier and Democratic Party power-player
Averell Harriman saw his life drawing to a close. He was seventy-nine, his
wife of many years, Marie, had just died, and with the Democrats out

85

•

of office his political career seemed over. Feeling old and depressed, he
resigned himself to spending his last years with his grandchildren in quiet
retirement.
A few months after Marie's death, Harriman was talked into attending a
Washington party. There he met an old friend, Pamela Churchill, whom he
had known during World War II, in London, where he had been sent as a
personal envoy of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. She was twenty-one at
the time, and was the wife of Winston Churchill's son Randolph. There
had certainly been more beautiful women in the city, but none had been
more pleasant to be around: she was so attentive, listening to his problems,
befriending his daughter (they were the same age), and calming him whenever he saw her. Marie had remained in the States, and Randolph was in
the army, so while bombs rained on London Averell and Pamela had begun
an affair. And in the many years since the war, she had kept in touch with
him: he knew about the breakup of her marriage, and about her endless series of affairs with Europe's wealthiest playboys. Yet he had not seen her
since his return to America, and to his wife. What a strange coincidence to
run into her at this particular moment in his life.
At the party Pamela pulled Harriman out of his shell, laughing at his
jokes and getting him to talk about London in the glory days of the war.
He felt his old power returning—it was as if he were charming her. A few
days later she dropped in on him at one of his weekend homes. Harriman
was one of the wealthiest men in the world, but was no lavish spender; he
and Marie had lived a Spartan life. Pamela made no comment, but when
she invited him to her own home, he could not help but notice the brightness and vibrancy of her life—flowers everywhere, beautiful linens on the
bed, wonderful meals (she seemed to know all of his favorite foods). He
had heard of her reputation as a courtesan and understood the lure of his
wealth, yet being around her was invigorating, and eight weeks after that
party, he married her.
Pamela did not stop there. She persuaded her husband to donate the art
that Marie had collected to the National Gallery. She got him to part with
some of his money—a trust fund for her son Winston, new houses, constant
redecorations. Her approach was subtle and patient; she made him somehow
feel good about giving her what she wanted. Within a few years, hardly any
traces of Marie remained in their life. Harriman spent less time with his
children and grandchildren. He seemed to be going through a second youth.
In Washington, politicians and their wives viewed Pamela with suspicion. They saw through her, and were immune to her charm, or so they
thought. Yet they always came to the frequent parties she hosted, justifying themselves with the thought that powerful people would be there.
Everything at these parties was calibrated to create a relaxed, intimate
atmosphere. No one felt ignored: the least important people would find
themselves talking to Pamela, opening up to that attentive look of hers. She
made them feel powerful and respected. Afterward she would send them a

personal note or gift, often referring to something they had mentioned in
conversation. The wives who had called her a courtesan and worse slowly
changed their minds. The men found her not only beguiling but useful—
her worldwide contacts were invaluable. She could put them in touch with
exactly the right person without them even having to ask. The Harrimans'
parties soon evolved into fundraising events for the Democratic Party. Put
at their ease, feeling elevated by the aristocratic atmosphere Pamela created
and the sense of importance she gave them, visitors would empty their wallets without realizing quite why. This, of course, was exactly what all the
men in her life had done.
In 1986, Averell Harriman died. By then Pamela was powerful and
wealthy enough that she no longer needed a man. In 1993, she was named
the U.S. ambassador to France, and easily transferred her personal and social
charm into the world of political diplomacy. She was still working when
she died, in 1997.
We often recognize Charmers as such; we sense their cleverness. (Surely
Harriman must have realized that his meeting with Pamela Churchill in
1971 was no coincidence.) Nevertheless, we fall under their spell. The reason is simple: the feeling that Charmers provide is so rare as to be worth the
price we pay.
The world is full of self-absorbed people. In their presence, we know that
everything in our relationship with them is directed toward themselves—
their insecurities, their neediness, their hunger for attention. That reinforces our own egocentric tendencies; we protectively close ourselves up. It
is a syndrome that only makes us the more helpless with Charmers. First,
they don't talk much about themselves, which heightens their mystery and
disguises their limitations. Second, they seem to be interested in us, and
their interest is so delightfully focused that we relax and open up to them.
Finally, Charmers are pleasant to be around. They have none of most people's ugly qualities—nagging, complaining, self-assertion. They seem to
know what pleases. Theirs is a diffused warmth; union without sex. (You
may think a geisha is sexual as well as charming; her power, however, lies
not in the sexual favors she provides but in her rare self-effacing attentiveness.) Inevitably, we become addicted, and dependent. And dependence is
the source of the Charmer's power.
People who are physically beautiful, and who play on their beauty to
create a sexually charged presence, have little power in the end; the bloom
of youth fades, there is always someone younger and more beautiful, and
in any case people tire of beauty without social grace. But they never tire
of feeling their self-worth validated. Learn the power you can wield by
making the other person feel like the star. The key is to diffuse your sexual
presence: create a vaguer, more beguiling sense of excitement through a
generalized flirtation, a socialized sexuality that is constant, addictive, and
never totally satisfied.

The Art of Seduction

3. In December of 1936, Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Chinese Nationalists, was captured by a group of his own soldiers who were angry with his
policies: instead of fighting the Japanese, who had just invaded China, he
was continuing his civil war against the Communist armies of Mao Zedong. The soldiers saw no threat in Mao—Chiang had almost annhilated
the Communists. In fact, they believed he should join forces with Mao
against the common enemy—it was the only patriotic thing to do. The soldiers thought by capturing him they could compel Chiang to change his
mind, but he was a stubborn man. Since Chiang was the main impediment
to a unified war against the Japanese, the soldiers contemplated having him
executed, or turned over to the Communists.
As Chiang lay in prison, he could only imagine the worst. Several days
later he received a visit from Zhou Enlai—a former friend and now a leading Communist. Politely and respectfully, Zhou argued for a united front:
Communists and Nationalists against the Japanese. Chiang could not begin
to hear such talk; he hated the Communists with a passion, and became
hopelessly emotional. To sign an agreement with the Communists in these
circumstances, he yelled, would be humiliating, and would lose me all
honor among my own army. It's out of the question. Kill me if you must.
Zhou listened, smiled, said barely a word. As Chiang's rant ended he
told the Nationalist general that a concern for honor was something he
understood, but that the honorable thing for them to do was actually to
forget their differences and fight the invader. Chiang could lead both
armies. Finally, Zhou said that under no circumstances would he allow his
fellow Communists, or anyone for that matter, to execute such a great man
as Chiang Kai-shek. The Nationalist leader was stunned and moved.
The next day, Chiang was escorted out of prison by Communist
guards, transferred to one of his own army's planes, and sent back to his
own headquarters. Apparently Zhou had executed this policy on his own,
for when word of it reached the other Communist leaders, they were outraged: Zhou should have forced Chiang to fight the Japanese, or else should
have ordered his execution—to release him without concessions was the
height of pusillanimity, and Zhou would pay. Zhou said nothing and
waited. A few months later, Chiang signed an agreement to halt the civil
war and join with the Communists against the Japanese. He seemed to have
come to his decision on his own, and his army respected it—they could not
doubt his motives.
Working together, the Nationalists and the Communists expelled the
Japanese from China. But the Communists, whom Chiang had previously
almost destroyed, took advantage of this period of collaboration to regain
strength. Once the Japanese had left, they turned on the Nationalists, who,
in 1949, were forced to evacuate mainland China for the island of Formosa, now Taiwan.
Now Mao paid a visit to the Soviet Union. China was in terrible shape
and in desperate need of assistance, but Stalin was wary of the Chinese, and
lectured Mao about the many mistakes he had made. Mao argued back.

The Charmer •

Stalin decided to teach the young upstart a lesson; he would give China
nothing. Tempers rose. Mao sent urgently for Zhou Enlai who arrived the
next day and went right to work.
In the long negotiating sessions, Zhou made a show of enjoying his
hosts' vodka. He never argued, and in fact agreed that the Chinese had
made many mistakes, had much to learn from the more experienced Soviets: "Comrade Stalin," he said, "we are the first large Asian country to join
the socialist camp under your guidance." Zhou had come prepared with all
kinds of neatly drawn diagrams and charts, knowing the Russians loved
such things. Stalin warmed up to him. The negotiations proceeded, and a
few days after Zhou's arrival, the two parties signed a treaty of mutual aid—
a treaty far more useful to the Chinese than to the Soviets.
In 1959, China was again in deep trouble. Mao's Great Leap Forward,
an attempt to spark an overnight industrial revolution in China, had been
a devastating failure. The people were angry: they were starving while
Beijing bureaucrats lived well. Many Beijing officials, Zhou among them,
returned to their native towns to try to bring order. Most of them managed
by bribes—by promising all kinds of favors—but Zhou proceeded differently: he visited his ancestral graveyard, where generations of his family
were buried, and ordered that the tombstones be removed and the coffins
buried deeper. Now the land could be farmed for food. In Confucian
terms (and Zhou was an obedient Confucian), this was sacrilege, but everyone knew what it meant: Zhou was willing to suffer personally. Everyone had to sacrifice, even the leaders. His gesture had immense symbolic
impact.
When Zhou died, in 1976, an unofficial and unorganized outpouring
of public grief caught the government by surprise. They could not understand how a man who had worked behind the scenes, and had shunned the
adoration of the masses, could have won such affection.
The capture of Chiang Kai-shek was a turning point in the civil war. To
execute him might have been disastrous: it had been Chiang who had held
the Nationalist army together, and without him it could have broken up
into factions, allowing the Japanese to overrun the country. To force him to
sign an agreement would have not helped either: he would have lost face
before his army, would never have honored the agreement, and would have
done everything he could to avenge his humiliation. Zhou knew that to
execute or compel a captive will only embolden your enemy, and will have
repercussions you cannot control. Charm, on the other hand, is a manipulative weapon that disguises its own manipulativeness, letting you gain a
victory without stirring the desire for revenge.
Zhou worked on Chiang perfectly, paying him respect, playing the inferior, letting him pass from the fear of execution to the relief of unexpected release. The general was allowed to leave with his dignity intact.
Zhou knew all this would soften him up, planting the seed of the idea that
perhaps the Communists were not so bad after all, and that he could change

89

•

The Art of Seduction

his mind about them without looking weak, particularly if he did so independently rather than while he was in prison. Zhou applied the same philosophy to every situation: play the inferior, unthreatening and humble.
What will this matter if in the end you get what you want: time to recover
from a civil war, a treaty, the good will of the masses.
Time is the greatest weapon you have. Patiently keep in mind a longterm goal and neither person nor army can resist you. And charm is the
best way of playing for time, of widening your options in any situation.
Through charm you can seduce your enemy into backing off, giving you
the psychological space to plot an effective counterstrategy. The key is to
make other people emotional while you remain detached. They may feel
grateful, happy, moved, arrogant—it doesn't matter, as long as they feel. An
emotional person is a distracted person. Give them what they want, appeal
to their self-interest, make them feel superior to you. When a baby has
grabbed a sharp knife, do not try to grab it back; instead, stay calm, offer
candy, and the baby will drop the knife to pick up the tempting morsel you
offer.

4. In 1761, Empress Elizabeth of Russia died, and her nephew ascended to
the throne as Czar Peter III. Peter had always been a little boy at heart—he
played with toy soldiers long past the appropriate age—and now, as czar, he
could finally do whatever he pleased and the world be damned. Peter concluded a treaty with Frederick the Great that was highly favorable to the
foreign ruler (Peter adored Frederick, and particularly the disciplined way
his Prussian soldiers marched). This was a practical debacle, but in matters
of emotion and etiquette, Peter was even more offensive: he refused to
properly mourn his aunt the empress, resuming his war games and parties a
few days after the funeral. What a contrast he was to his wife, Catherine.
She was respectful during the funeral, was still wearing black months later,
and could be seen at all hours beside Elizabeth's tomb, praying and crying. She was not even Russian, but a German princess who had come east
to marry Peter in 1745 without speaking a word of the language. Even the
lowest peasant knew that Catherine had converted to the Russian Orthodox Church, and had learned to speak Russian with incredible speed, and
beautifully. At heart, they thought, she was more Russian than all of those
fops in the court.
During these difficult months, while Peter offended almost everyone in
the country, Catherine discreetly kept a lover, Gregory Orlov, a lieutenant
in the guards. It was through Orlov that word spread of her piety, her patriotism, her worthiness for rule; how much better to follow such a woman
than to serve Peter. Late into the night, Catherine and Orlov would talk,
and he would tell her the army was behind her and would urge her to stage
a coup. She would listen attentively, but would always reply that this was
not the time for such things. Orlov wondered to himself: perhaps she was
too gentle and passive for such a great step.

The Charmer • 91

Peter's regime was repressive, and the arrests and executions piled up.
He also grew more abusive toward his wife, threatening to divorce her and
marry his mistress. One drunken evening, driven to distraction by Catherine's silence and his inability to provoke her, he ordered her arrest. The
news spread fast, and Orlov hurried to warn Catherine that she would be
imprisoned or executed unless she acted fast. This time Catherine did not
argue; she put on her simplest mourning gown, left her hair half undone,
followed Orlov to a waiting carriage, and rushed to the army barracks.
Here the soldiers fell to the ground, kissing the hem of her dress—they had
heard so much about her but had never seen her in person, and she seemed
to them like a statue of the Madonna come to life. They gave her an army
uniform, marveling at how beautiful she looked in men's clothes, and set
off under Orlov's command for the Winter Palace. The procession grew as
it passed through the streets of St. Petersburg. Everyone applauded Catherine, everyone felt that Peter should be dethroned. Soon priests arrived to
give Catherine their blessing, making the people even more excited. And
through it all, she was silent and dignified, as if all were in the hands of fate.
When news reached Peter of this peaceful rebellion, he grew hysterical,
and agreed to abdicate that very night. Catherine became empress without
a single battle or even a single gunshot.
As a child, Catherine was intelligent and spirited. Since her mother had
wanted a daughter who was obedient rather than dazzling, and who would
therefore make a better match, the child was subjected to a constant barrage
of criticism, against which she developed a defense: she learned to seem to
defer to other people totally as a way to neutralize their aggression. If she
was patient and did not force the issue, instead of attacking her they would
fall under her spell.
When Catherine came to Russia—at the age of sixteen, without a
friend or ally in the country—she applied the skills she had learned in
dealing with her difficult mother. In the face of all the court monsters—
the imposing Empress Elizabeth, her own infantile husband, the endless
schemers and betrayers—she curtseyed, deferred, waited, and charmed. She
had long wanted to rule as empress, and knew how hopeless her husband
was. But what good would it do to seize power violently, laying a claim that
some would certainly see as illegitimate, and then have to worry endlessly
that she would be dethroned in turn? No, the moment had to be ripe, and
she had to make the people carry her into power. It was a feminine style of
revolution: by being passive and patient, Catherine suggested that she had
no interest in power. The effect was soothing—charming.
There will always be difficult people for us to face—the chronically insecure, the hopelessly stubborn, the hysterical complainers. Your ability to
disarm these people will prove an invaluable skill. You do have to be careful, though: if you are passive they will run all over you; if assertive you will
make their monstrous qualities worse. Seduction and charm are the most
effective counterweapons. Outwardly, be gracious. Adapt to their every

mood. Enter their spirit. Inwardly, calculate and wait: your surrender is a
strategy, not a way of life. When the time comes, and it inevitably will, the
tables will turn. Their aggression will land them in trouble, and that will
put you in a position to rescue them, regaining superiority. (You could also
decide that you had had enough, and consign them to oblivion.) Your
charm has prevented them from foreseeing this or growing suspicious. A
whole revolution can be enacted without a single act of violence, simply by
waiting for the apple to ripen and fall.

Dangers

T

here are those who are immune to a Charmer; particularly cynics, and
confident types who do not need validation. These people tend to
view Charmers as slippery and deceitful, and they can make problems for
you. The solution is to do what most Charmers do by nature: befriend and
charm as many people as possible. Secure your power through numbers and
you will not have to worry about the few you cannot seduce. Catherine the
Great's kindness to everyone she met created a vast amount of good will
that paid off later. Also, it is sometimes charming to reveal a strategic flaw.
There is one person you dislike? Confess it openly, do not try to charm
such an enemy, and people will think you more human, less slippery. Disraeli had such a scapegoat with his great nemesis, William Gladstone.
The dangers of political charm are harder to handle: your conciliatory,
shifting, flexible approach to politics will make enemies out of everyone
who is a rigid believer in a cause. Social seducers such as Bill Clinton and
Henry Kissinger could often win over the most hardened opponent with
their personal charm, but they could not be everywhere at once. Many
members of the English Parliament thought Disraeli a shifty conniver; in
person his engaging manner could dispel such feelings, but he could not
address the entire Parliament one-on-one. In difficult times, when people
yearn for something substantial and firm, the political charmer may be in
danger.
As Catherine the Great proved, timing is everything. Charmers must
know when to hibernate and when the times are ripe for their persuasive
powers. Known for their flexibility, they should sometimes be flexible
enough to act inflexibly. Zhou Enlai, the consummate chameleon, could
play the hard-core Communist when it suited him. Never become the slave
to your own powers of charm; keep it under control, something you can
turn off and on at will.

harisma is seduction on a mass level. Charismatics make crowds of
people fall in love with them, then lead them along. The process of
making them fall in love is simple and follows a path similar to that of a
one-on-one seduction. Charismatics have certain qualities that are powerfully attractive and that make them stand out. This could be their selfbelief, their boldness, their serenity. They keep the source of these qualities
mysterious. They do not explain where their confidence or contentment "Charisma" shall be

visions—would stand out as one whom the gods had singled out. And this
man, a priest or a prophet, gained great power over others. What made the
Hebrews believe in Moses, follow him out of Egypt, and remain loyal to
him despite their endless wandering in the desert? The look in his eye, his
inspired and inspiring words, the face that literally glowed when he came
down from Mount Sinai—all these things gave him the appearance of having direct communication with God, and were the source of his authority.
And these were what was meant by "charisma," a Greek word referring to
prophets and to Christ himself. In early Christianity, charisma was a gift or
talent vouchsafed by God's grace and revealing His presence. Most of the
great religions were founded by a Charismatic, a person who physically displayed the signs of God's favor.
Over the years, the world became more rational. Eventually people
came to hold power not by divine right but because they won votes, or
proved their competence. The great early-twentieth-century German soci97

The Charismatic •

in dealing with the country's many problems, that the public began to see
him as their savior, someone with intense charisma.

Mystery. Mystery lies at charisma's heart, but it is a particular kind of
mystery—a mystery expressed by contradiction. The Charismatic may be
both proletarian and aristocratic (Mao Zedong), both cruel and kind (Peter
the Great), both excitable and icily detached (Charles de Gaulle), both intimate and distant (Sigmund Freud). Since most people are predictable, the
effect of these contradictions is devastatingly charismatic. They make you
hard to fathom, add richness to your character, make people talk about you.
It is often better to reveal your contradictions slowly and subtly—if you
throw them out one on top of the other, people may think you have an erratic personality. Show your mysteriousness gradually and word will spread.
You must also keep people at arm's length, to keep them from figuring
you out.
Another aspect of mystery is a hint of the uncanny. The appearance of
prophetic or psychic gifts will add to your aura. Predict things authoritatively and people will often imagine that what you have said has come true.

Saintliness. Most of us must compromise constantly to survive; saints do
not. They must live out their ideals without caring about the consequences.
The saintly effect bestows charisma.
Saintliness goes far beyond religion: politicians as disparate as George
Washington and Lenin won saintly reputations by living simply, despite
their power—by matching their political values to their personal lives. Both
men were virtually deified after they died. Albert Einstein too had a saintly
aura—childlike, unwilling to compromise, lost in his own world. The key
is that you must already have some deeply held values; that part cannot be
faked, at least not without risking accusations of charlatanry that will destroy your charisma in the long run. The next step is to show, as simply and
subtly as possible, that you live what you believe. Finally, the appearance of
being mild and unassuming can eventually turn into charisma, as long as
you seem completely comfortable with it. The source of Harry Truman's
charisma, and even of Abraham Lincoln's, was to appear to be an Everyman.

Eloquence. A Charismatic relies on the power of words. The reason is
simple: words are the quickest way to create emotional disturbance. They
can uplift, elevate, stir anger, without referring to anything real. During the
Spanish Civil War, Dolores Gómez Ibarruri, known as La Pasionaria, gave
pro-Communist speeches that were so emotionally powerful as to determine several key moments in the war. To bring off this kind of eloquence,
it helps if the speaker is as emotional, as caught up in words, as the audience is. Yet eloquence can be learned: the devices La Pasionaria used—

catchwords, slogans, rhythmic repetitions, phrases for the audience to repeat—can easily be acquired. Roosevelt, a calm, patrician type, was able to
make himself a dynamic speaker, both through his style of delivery, which
was slow and hypnotic, and through his brilliant use of imagery, alliteration, and biblical rhetoric. The crowds at his rallies were often moved to
tears. The slow, authoritative style is often more effective than passion in
the long run, for it is more subtly spellbinding, and less tiring.

Theatricality. A Charismatic is larger than life, has extra presence. Actors
have studied this kind of presence for centuries; they know how to stand
on a crowded stage and command attention. Surprisingly, it is not the actor
who screams the loudest or gestures the most wildly who works this magic
best, but the actor who stays calm, radiating self-assurance. The effect is
ruined by trying too hard. It is essential to be self-aware, to have the ability
to see yourself as others see you. De Gaulle understood that self-awareness
was key to his charisma; in the most turbulent circumstances—the Nazi
occupation of France, the national reconstruction after World War II,
an army rebellion in Algeria—he retained an Olympian composure that
played beautifully against the hysteria of his colleagues. When he spoke, no
one could take their eyes off him. Once you know how to command attention this way, heighten the effect by appearing in ceremonial and ritual
events that are full of exciting imagery, making you look regal and godlike.
Flamboyancy has nothing to do with charisma—it attracts the wrong kind
of attention.

Uninhibitedness. Most people are repressed, and have little access to their
unconscious—a problem that creates opportunities for the Charismatic,
who can become a kind of screen on which others project their secret fantasies and longings. You will first have to show that you are less inhibited
than your audience—that you radiate a dangerous sexuality, have no fear of
death, are delightfully spontaneous. Even a hint of these qualities will make
people think you more powerful than you are. In the 1850s a bohemian
American actress, Adah Isaacs Menken, took the world by storm through
her unbridled sexual energy, and her fearlessness. She would appear on
stage half-naked, performing death-defying acts; few women could dare
such things in the Victorian period, and a rather mediocre actress became a
figure of cultlike adoration.
An extension of your being uninhibited is a dreamlike quality in your
work and character that reveals your openness to your unconscious. It was
the possession of this quality that transformed artists like Wagner and Picasso into charismatic idols. Its cousin is a fluidity of body and spirit; while
the repressed are rigid, Charismatics have an ease and an adaptability that
show their openness to experience.

The Charismatic

Fervency. You need to believe in something, and to believe in it strongly
enough for it to animate all your gestures and make your eyes light up. This
cannot be faked. Politicians inevitably lie to the public; what distinguishes
Charismatics is that they believe their own lies, which makes them that
much more believable. A prerequisite for fiery belief is some great cause to
rally around—a crusade. Become the rallying point for people's discontent,
and show that you share none of the doubts that plague normal humans. In
1490, the Florentine Girolamo Savonarola railed at the immorality of the
pope and the Catholic Church. Claiming to be divinely inspired, he became so animated during his sermons that hysteria would sweep the crowd.
Savonarola developed such a following that he briefly took over the city,
until the pope had him captured and burned at the stake. People believed in
him because of the depth of his conviction. His example has more relevance today than ever: people are more and more isolated, and long for
communal experience. Let your own fervent and contagious faith, in virtually anything, give them something to believe in.

Vulnerability. Charismatics display a need for love and affection. They are
open to their audience, and in fact feed off its energy; the audience in turn
is electrified by the Charismatic, the current increasing as it passes back and
forth. This vulnerable side to charisma softens the self-confident side,
which can seem fanatical and frightening.
Since charisma involves feelings akin to love, you in turn must reveal
your love for your followers. This was a key component to the charisma
that Marilyn Monroe radiated on camera. "I knew I belonged to the Public," she wrote in her diary, "and to the world, not because I was talented or
even beautiful but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else.
The Public was the only family, the only Prince Charming and the only
home I had ever dreamed of." In front of a camera, Monroe suddenly came
to life, flirting with and exciting her unseen public. If the audience does
not sense this quality in you they will turn away from you. On the other
hand, you must never seem manipulative or needy. Imagine your public as a
single person whom you are trying to seduce—nothing is more seductive
to people than the feeling that they are desired.

Adventurousness. Charismatics are unconventional. They have an air of
adventure and risk that attracts the bored. Be brazen and courageous in
your actions—be seen taking risks for the good of others. Napoleon made
sure his soldiers saw him at the cannons in battle. Lenin walked openly on
the streets, despite the death threats he had received. Charismatics thrive in
troubled waters; a crisis situation allows them to flaunt their daring, which
enhances their aura. John F. Kennedy came to life in dealing with the
Cuban missile crisis, Charles de Gaulle when he confronted rebellion in

she was not really a soldier

Algeria. They needed these problems to seem charismatic, and in fact some
have even accused them of stirring up situations (Kennedy through his
brinkmanship style of diplomacy, for instance) that played to their love of
adventure. Show heroism to give yourself a charisma that will last you a
lifetime. Conversely, the slightest sign of cowardice or timidity will ruin
whatever charisma you had.

Magnetism. If any physical attribute is crucial in seduction, it is the eyes.
They reveal excitement, tension, detachment, without a word being spoken. Indirect communication is critical in seduction, and also in charisma.
The demeanor of Charismatics may be poised and calm, but their eyes are
magnetic; they have a piercing gaze that disturbs their targets' emotions,
exerting force without words or action. Fidel Castro's aggressive gaze can
reduce his opponents to silence. When Benito Mussolini was challenged,
he would roll his eyes, showing the whites in a way that frightened people.
President Kusnasosro Sukarno of Indonesia had a gaze that seemed as if it
could have read thoughts. Roosevelt could dilate his pupils at will, making
his stare both hypnotizing and intimidating. The eyes of the Charismatic
never show fear or nerves.
All of these skills are acquirable. Napoleon spent hours in front of a
mirror, modeling his gaze on that of the great contemporary actor Talma.
The key is self-control. The look does not necessarily have to be aggressive;
it can also show contentment. Remember: your eyes can emanate charisma,

Charismatic Types—Historical Examples
The miraculous prophet. In the year 1425, Joan of Arc, a peasant girl
from the French village of Domrémy, had her first vision: "I was in my
thirteenth year when God sent a voice to guide me." The voice was that of
Saint Michael and he came with a message from God: Joan had been chosen to rid France of the English invaders who now ruled most of the
country, and of the resulting chaos and war. She was also to restore the
French crown to the prince—the Dauphin, later Charles VII—who was its
rightful heir. Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret also spoke to Joan. Her
visions were extraordinarily vivid: she saw Saint Michael, touched him,
smelled him.

The Charismatic •

At first Joan told no one what she had seen; for all anyone knew, she
was a quiet farm girl. But the visions became even more intense, and so in
1429 she left Domrémy, determined to realize the mission for which God
had chosen her. Her goal was to meet Charles in the town of Chinon,
where he had established his court in exile. The obstacles were enormous: Chinon was far, the journey was dangerous, and Charles, even if she
reached him, was a lazy and cowardly young man who was unlikely to crusade against the English. Undaunted, she moved from village to village, explaining her mission to soldiers and asking them to escort her to Chinon.
Young girls with religious visions were a dime a dozen at the time, and
there was nothing in Joan's appearance to inspire confidence; one soldier,
however, Jean de Metz, was intrigued with her. What fascinated him was
the detail of her visions: she would liberate the besieged town of Orléans,
have the king crowned at the cathedral in Reims, lead the army to Paris;
she knew how she would be wounded, and where; the words she attributed
to Saint Michael were quite unlike the language of a farm girl; and she was
so calmly confident, she glowed with conviction. De Metz fell under her
spell. He swore allegiance and set out with her for Chinon. Soon others offered assistance, too, and word reached Charles of the strange young girl on
her way to meet him.
On the 350-mile road to Chinon, accompanied only by a handful of
soldiers, through a land infested with warring bands, Joan showed neither
fear nor hesitation. The journey took several months. When she finally arrived, the Dauphin decided to meet the girl who had promised to restore
him to his throne, despite the advice of his counselors; but he was bored,
and wanted amusement, and decided to play a trick on her. She was to
meet him in a hall packed with courtiers; to test her prophetic powers, he
disguised himself as one of these men, and dressed another man as the
prince. Yet when Joan arrived, to the amazement of the crowd, she walked
straight up to Charles and curtseyed: "The King of Heaven sends me to
you with the message that you shall be the lieutenant of the King of
Heaven, who is the king of France." In the talk that followed, Joan seemed
to echo Charles's most private thoughts, while once again recounting in
extraordinary detail the feats she would accomplish. Days later, this indecisive, flighty man declared himself convinced and gave her his blessing to
lead a French army against the English.
Miracles and saintliness aside, Joan of Arc had certain basic qualities that
made her exceptional. Her visions were intense; she could describe them in
such detail that they had to be real. Details have that effect: they lend a
sense of reality to even the most preposterous statements. Furthermore, in a
time of great disorder, she was supremely focused, as if her strength came
from somewhere unworldly. She spoke with authority, and she predicted
things people wanted: the English would be defeated, prosperity would return. She also had a peasant's earthy common sense. She had surely heard
descriptions of Charles on the road to Chinon; once at court, she could

in salons throughout the city, he led the guests in a folk song, and as they
sang, he began to dance, a strange uninhibited dance of his own design,
and as he danced, he circled the most attractive women there, and with his
eyes invited them to join him. The dance turned vaguely sexual; as his
partners fell under his spell, he whispered suggestive comments in their
ears. Yet none of them seemed to be offended.
Over the next few months, women from every level of St. Petersburg
society visited Rasputin in his apartment. He would talk to them of spiritual matters, but then without warning he would turn sexual, murmuring
the crassest come-ons. He would justify himself through spiritual dogma:
how can you repent if you have not sinned? Salvation only comes to those
who go astray. One of the few who rejected his advances was asked by a
friend, "How can one refuse anything to a saint?" "Does a saint need sinful
love?" she replied. Her friend said, "He makes everything that comes near
him holy. I have already belonged to him, and I am proud and happy to
have done so." "But you are married! What does your husband say?" "He
considers it a very great honor. If Rasputin desires a woman we all think it
a blessing and a distinction, our husbands as well as ourselves."
Rasputin's spell soon extended over Czar Nicholas and more particularly over his wife, the Czarina Alexandra, after he apparently healed their
son from a life-threatening injury. Within a few years, he had become the
most powerful man in Russia, with total sway over the royal couple.
People are more complicated than the masks they wear in society. The man
who seems so noble and gentle is probably disguising a dark side, which
will often come out in strange ways; if his nobility and refinement are in
fact a put-on, sooner or later the truth will out, and his hypocrisy will disappoint and alienate. On the other hand, we are drawn to people who
seem more comfortably human, who do not bother to disguise their contradictions. This was the source of Rasputin's charisma. A man so authentically himself, so devoid of self-consciousness or hypocrisy, was immensely
appealing. His wickedness and saintliness were so extreme that it made him
seem larger than life. The result was a charismatic aura that was immediate
and preverbal; it radiated from his eyes, and from the touch of his hands.
Most of us are a mix of the devil and the saint, the noble and the ignoble, and we spend our lives trying to repress the dark side. Few of us can
give free rein to both sides, as Rasputin did, but we can create charisma to a
smaller degree by ridding ourselves of self-consciousness, and of the discomfort most of us feel about our complicated natures. You cannot help

The demonic performer. Throughout his childhood Elvis Presley was
thought a strange boy who kept pretty much to himself. In high school in
Memphis, Tennessee, he attracted attention with his pompadoured hair and
sideburns, his pink and black clothing, but people who tried to talk to him
found nothing there—he was either terribly bland or hopelessly shy. At the
high school prom, he was the only boy who didn't dance. He seemed lost
in a private world, in love with the guitar he took everywhere. At the Ellis
Auditorium, at the end of an evening of gospel music or wrestling, the
concessions manager would often find Elvis onstage, miming a performance and taking bows before an imaginary audience. Asked to leave, he
would quietly walk away. He was a very polite young man.

EDITED BY HANS GERTH AND
C . WRIGHT MILLS year later the owner of the studio, Sam Phillips, called him in to record two
blues songs with a couple of professional musicians. They worked for
hours, but nothing seemed to click; Elvis was nervous and inhibited. Then,
near the end of the evening, giddy with exhaustion, he suddenly let loose
and started to jump around like a child, in a moment of complete selfabandon. The other musicians joined in, the song getting wilder and
wilder. Phillips's eyes lit up—he had something here.
A month later Elvis gave his first public performance, outdoors in a
Memphis park. He was as nervous as he had been at the recording session,
and could only stutter when he had to speak; but once he broke into song,
the words came out. The crowd responded excitedly, rising to peaks at
certain moments. Elvis couldn't figure out why. "I went over to the manager after the song," he later said, "and I asked him what was making the
crowd go nuts. He told me, 'I'm not really sure, but I think that every
time you wiggle your left leg, they start to scream. Whatever it is, just
don't stop.'
A single Elvis recorded in 1954 became a hit. Soon he was in demand.
Going onstage filled him with anxiety and emotion, so much so that he
became a different person, as if possessed. "I've talked to some singers
and they get a little nervous, but they say their nerves kind of settle down
after they get into it. Mine never do. It's sort of this energy . . . something
maybe like sex." Over the next few months he discovered more gestures
and sounds—twitching dance movements, a more tremulous voice—that
made the crowds go crazy, particularly teenage girls. Within a year he had
become the hottest musician in America. His concerts were exercises in
mass hysteria.

waits and searches for a
new holder of charisma.

Elvis Presley had a dark side, a secret life. (Some have attributed it to the
death, at birth, of his twin brother.) This dark side he deeply repressed as a
young man; it included all kinds of fantasies which he could only give in to
when he was alone, although his unconventional clothing may also have
been a symptom of it. When he performed, though, he was able to let
these demons loose. They came out as a dangerous sexual power. Twitch-

The Savior. In March of 1917, the Russian parliament forced the country's ruler, Czar Nicholas, to abdicate and established a provisional government. Russia was in rums. Its participation in World War I had been a
disaster; famine was spreading widely, the vast countryside was riven by
looting and lynch law, and soldiers were deserting from the army en masse.
Politically the country was bitterly divided; the main factions were the
right, the social democrats, and the left-wing revolutionaries, and each of
these groups was itself afflicted by dissension.
Into this chaos came the forty-seven-year-old Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. A
Marxist revolutionary, the leader of the Bolshevik Communist party, he
had suffered a twelve-year exile in Europe until, recognizing the chaos
overcoming Russia as the chance he had long been waiting for, he had hurried back home. Now he called for the country to end its participation in
the war and for an immediate socialist revolution. In the first weeks after his
arrival, nothing could have seemed more ridiculous. As a man, Lenin
looked unimpressive; he was short and plain-featured. He had also spent
years away in Europe, isolated from his people and immersed in reading and
intellectual argument. Most important, his party was small, representing
only a splinter group within the loosely organized left coalition. Few took
him seriously as a national leader.
Undaunted, Lenin went to work. Wherever he went, he repeated the
same simple message: end the war, establish the rule of the proletariat,
abolish private property, redistribute wealth. Exhausted with the nation's
endless political infighting and the complexity of its problems, people began to listen. Lenin was so determined, so confident. He never lost his

pressed by his firmness. Once, in the midst of a brewing riot, Lenin amazed
his chauffeur by jumping onto the running board of his car and directing
the way through the crowd, at considerable personal risk. Told that his ideas
had nothing to do with reality, he would answer, "So much the worse for
reality!"
Allied to Lenin's messianic confidence in his cause was his ability to organize. Exiled in Europe, his party had been scattered and diminished; in
keeping them together he had developed immense practical skills. In front
of a large crowd, he was a also powerful orator. His speech at the First AllRussian Soviet Congress made a sensation; either revolution or a bourgeois
government, he cried, but nothing in between—enough of this compromise in which the left was sharing. At a time when other politicians were
scrambling desperately to adapt to the national crisis, and seemed weak in
the process, Lenin was rock stable. His prestige soared, as did the membership of the Bolshevik party

The guru. According to the beliefs of the Theosophical Society, every two
thousand years or so the spirit of the World Teacher, Lord Maitreya, inhabits the body of a human. First there was Sri Krishna, born two thousand
years before Christ; then there was Jesus himself; and at the start of the
twentieth century another incarnation was due. One day in 1909, the
theosophist Charles Leadbeater saw a boy on an Indian beach and had an
epiphany: this fourteen-year-old lad, Jiddu Krishnamurti, would be the
World Teacher's next vehicle. Leadbeater was struck by the simplicity of
the boy, who seemed to lack the slightest trace of selfishness. The members
of the Theosophical Society agreed with his assessment and adopted this
scraggly underfed youth, whose teachers had repeatedly beaten him for stupidity. They fed and clothed him and began his spiritual instruction. The
scruffy urchin turned into a devilishly handsome young man.
In 1911, the theosophists formed the Order of the Star in the East, a
group intended to prepare the way for the coming of the World Teacher.
Krishnamurti was made head of the order. He was taken to England, where
his education continued, and everywhere he went he was pampered and
revered. His air of simplicity and contentment could not help but impress.
Soon Krishnamurti began to have visions. In 1922 he declared, "I have
drunk at the fountain of Joy and eternal Beauty. I am God-intoxicated."
Over the next few years he had psychic experiences that the theosophists
interpreted as visits from the World Teacher. But Krishnamurti had actually
had a different kind of revelation: the truth of the universe came from
within. No god, no guru, no dogma could ever make one realize it. He
himself was no god or messiah, but just another man. The reverence that
he was treated with disgusted him. In 1929, much to his followers' shock,
he disbanded the Order of the Star and resigned from the Theosophical
Society.
And so Krishnamurti became a philosopher, determined to spread the
truth he had discovered: you must be simple, removing the screen of language and past experience. Through these means anyone could attain contentment of the kind that radiated from Krishnamurti. The theosophists
abandoned him but his following grew larger than ever. In California,
where he spent much of his time, the interest in him verged on cultic adoration. The poet Robinson Jeffers said that whenever Krishnamurti entered
a room you could feel a brightness filling the space. The writer Aldous
Huxley met him in Los Angeles and fell under his spell. Hearing him
speak, he wrote: "It was like listening to the discourse of the Buddha—
such power, such intrinsic authority." The man radiated enlightenment.
The actor John Barrymore asked him to play the role of Buddha in a film.

MARYSA NAYARRO. EVITA Eva Duarte in one of the lavishly produced soap operas that were so popular at the time. She never made you laugh, but how often she could make
you cry—with the complaints of a betrayed lover, or the last words of
Marie Antoinette. The very thought of her voice made you shiver with
emotion. And she was pretty, with her flowing blond hair and her serious
face, which was often on the covers of the gossip magazines.

— N I C H O L A S FRASER AND

The

In 1943, those magazines published a most exciting story: Eva had
begun an affair with one of the most dashing men in the new military
government, Colonel Juan Perón. Now Argentines heard her doing propaganda spots for the government, lauding the "New Argentina" that glistened in the future. And finally, this fairy tale story reached its perfect
conclusion: in 1945 Juan and Eva married, and the following year, the
handsome colonel, after many trials and tribulations (including a spell in
prison, from which he was freed by the efforts of his devoted wife) was
elected president. He was a champion of the descamisados—the "shirtless
ones," the workers and the poor, just as his wife was. Only twenty-six at the
time, she had grown up in poverty herself.
Now that this star was the first lady of the republic, she seemed to
change. She lost weight, most definitely; her outfits became less flamboyant, even downright austere; and that beautiful flowing hair was now pulled
back, rather severely. It was a shame—the young star had grown up. But as
Argentines saw more of the new Evita, as she was now known, her new
look affected them more strongly. It was the look of a saintly, serious
woman, one who was indeed what her husband called the "Bridge of
Love" between himself and his people. She was now on the radio all the
time, and listening to her was as emotional as ever, but she also spoke magnificently in public. Her voice was lower and her delivery slower; she
stabbed the air with her fingers, reached out as if to touch the audience.
And her words pierced you to the core: "I left my dreams by the wayside in
order to watch over the dreams of others. . . . I now place my soul at the
side of the soul of my people. I offer them all my energies so that my body
may be a bridge erected toward the happiness of all. Pass over it . . . toward
the supreme destiny of the new fatherland."
It was no longer only through magazines and the radio that Evita made
herself felt. Almost everyone was personally touched by her in some way.
Everyone seemed to know someone who had met her, or who had visited
her in her office, where a line of supplicants wound its way through the
hallways to her door. Behind her desk she sat, so calm and full of love. Film
crews recorded her acts of charity: to a woman who had lost everything,
Evita would give a house; to one with a sick child, free care in the finest
hospital. She worked so hard, no wonder rumor had it that she was ill. And
everyone heard of her visits to the shanty towns and to hospitals for the
poor, where, against the wishes of her staff, she would kiss people with all
kinds of maladies (lepers, syphilitic men, etc.) on the cheek. Once an assistant appalled by this habit tried to dab Evita's lips with alcohol, to sterilize
them. This saint of a woman grabbed the bottle and smashed it against the
wall.
Yes, Evita was a saint, a living madonna. Her appearance alone could
heal the sick. And when she died of cancer, in 1952, no outsider to Argentina could possibly understand the sense of grief and loss she left behind. For some, the country never recovered.

The Art of Seduction

Most of us live in a semi-somnambulistic state: we do our daily tasks and
the days fly by. The two exceptions to this are childhood and those moments when we are in love. In both cases, our emotions are more engaged,
more open and active. And we equate feeling emotional with feeling more
alive. A public figure who can affect people's emotions, who can make
them feel communal sadness, joy, or hope, has a similar effect. An appeal to
the emotions is far more powerful than an appeal to reason.
Eva Perón knew this power early on, as a radio actress. Her tremulous
voice could make audiences weep; because of this, people saw in her great
charisma. She never forgot the experience. Her every public act was framed
in dramatic and religious motifs. Drama is condensed emotion, and the
Catholic religion is a force that reaches into your childhood, hits you where
you cannot help yourself. Evita's uplifted arms, her staged acts of charity,
her sacrifices for the common folk—all this went straight to the heart. It
was not her goodness alone that was charismatic, although the appearance of goodness is alluring enough. It was her ability to dramatize her
goodness.
You must learn to exploit the two great purveyors of emotion: drama
and religion. Drama cuts out the useless and banal in life, focusing on moments of pity and terror; religion deals with matters of life and death.
Make your charitable actions dramatic, give your loving words religious
import, bathe everything in rituals and myths going back to childhood.
Caught up in the emotions you stir, people will see over your head the halo
of charisma.

The deliverer. In Harlem in the early 1950s, few African-Americans knew
much about the Nation of Islam, or ever stepped into its temple. The Nation preached that white people were descended from the devil and that
someday Allah would liberate the black race. This doctrine had little meaning for Harlemites, who went to church for spiritual solace and turned in
practical matters to their local politicians. But in 1954, a new minister for
the Nation of Islam arrived in Harlem.
The minister's name was Malcolm X, and he was well-read and eloquent, yet his gestures and words were angry. Word spread: whites had
lynched Malcolm's father. He had grown up in a juvenile facility, then had
survived as a small-time hustler before being arrested for burglary and
spending six years in prison. His short life (he was only twenty—nine at the
time) had been one long run-in with the law, yet look at him now—so
confident and educated. No one had helped him; he had done it all on his
own. Harlemites began to see Malcolm X everywhere, handing out fliers,
addressing the young. He would stand outside their churches, and as the
congregation dispersed, he would point to the preacher and say, "He represents the white man's god; I represent the black man's god." The curious
began to come to hear him preach at a Nation of Islam temple. He would
ask them to look at the actual conditions of their lives: "When you get

The Charismatic •

through looking at where you live, then . . . take a walk across Central
Park," he would tell them. "Look at the white man's apartments. Look
at his Wall Street!" His words were powerful, particularly coming from a
minister.
In 1957, a young Muslim in Harlem witnessed the beating of a
drunken black man by several policemen. When the Muslim protested, the
police pummeled him senseless and carted him off to jail. An angry crowd
gathered outside the police station, ready to riot. Told that only Malcolm X
could forestall violence, the police commissioner brought him in and told
him to break up the mob. Malcolm refused. Speaking more temperately,
the commissioner begged him to reconsider. Malcolm calmly set conditions
for his cooperation: medical care for the beaten Muslim, and proper
punishment for the police officers. The commissioner reluctantly agreed.
Outside the station, Malcolm explained the agreement and the crowd
dispersed. In Harlem and around the country, he was an overnight hero—
finally a man who took action. Membership in his temple soared.
Malcolm began to speak all over the United States. He never read from
a text; looking out at the audience, he made eye contact, pointed his finger.
His anger was obvious, not so much in his tone—he was always controlled
and articulate—as in his fierce energy, the veins popping out on his neck.
Many earlier black leaders had used cautious words, and had asked their followers to deal patiently and politely with their social lot, no matter how
unfair. What a relief Malcolm was. He ridiculed the racists, he ridiculed
the liberals, he ridiculed the president; no white person escaped his scorn.
If whites were violent, Malcolm said, the language of violence should be
spoken back to them, for it was the only language they understood. "Hostility is good!" he cried out. "It's been bottled up too long." In response to
the growing popularity of the nonviolent leader Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Malcolm said, "Anybody can sit. An old woman can sit. A coward can
sit. . . . It takes a man to stand."
Malcolm X had a bracing effect on many who felt the same anger he
did but were frightened to express it. At his funeral—he was assassinated in
1965, at one of his speeches—the actor Ossie Davis delivered the eulogy
before a large and emotional crowd: "Malcolm," he said, "was our own
black shining prince."
Malcolm X was a Charismatic of Moses' kind: he was a deliverer. The
power of this sort of Charismatic comes from his or her expression of dark
emotions that have built up over years of oppression. In doing so, the deliverer provides an opportunity for the release of bottled-up emotions by
other people—of the hostility masked by forced politeness and smiles. Deliverers have to be one of the suffering crowd, only more so: their pain
must be exemplary. Malcolm's personal history was an integral part of his
charisma. His lesson—that blacks should help themselves, not wait for
whites to lift them up—meant a great deal more because of his own years
in prison, and because he had followed his own doctrine by educating him-

self, lifting himself up from the bottom. The deliverer must be a living example of personal redemption.
The essence of charisma is an overpowering emotion that communicates itself in your gestures, In your tone of voice, in subtle signs that are
the more powerful for being unspoken. You feel something more deeply
than others, and no emotion is more powerful and more capable of creating
a charismatic reaction than hatred, particularly if it comes from deeprooted feelings of oppression. Express what others are afraid to express and
they will see great power in you. Say what they want to say but cannot.
Never be afraid of going too far. If you represent a release from oppression,
you have the leeway to go still farther. Moses spoke of violence, of destroying every last one of his enemies. Language like this brings the oppressed
together and makes them feel more alive. This is not, however, something
that is uncontrollable on your part. Malcolm X felt rage from early on, but
only in prison did he teach himself the art of oratory, and how to channel
his emotions. Nothing is more charismatic than the sense that someone is
struggling with great emotion rather than simply giving in to it.

The Olympian actor. On January 24, 1960 an insurrection broke out in
Algeria, then still a French colony. Led by right-wing French soldiers, its
purpose was to forestall the proposal of President Charles de Gaulle to
grant Algeria the right of self-determination. If necessary, the insurrectionists would take over Algeria in the name of France.
For several tense days, the seventy-year-old de Gaulle maintained a
strange silence. Then on January 29, at eight in the evening, he appeared
on French national television. Before he had uttered a word, the audience
was astonished, for he wore his old uniform from World War II, a uniform
that everyone recognized and that created a strong emotional response. De
Gaulle had been the hero of the resistance, the savior of the country at its
darkest moment. But that uniform had not been seen for quite some time.
Then de Gaulle spoke, reminding his public, in his cool and confident
manner, of all they had accomplished together in liberating France from
the Germans. Slowly he moved from these charged patriotic issues to the
rebellion in Algeria, and the affront it presented to the spirit of the liberation. He finished his address by repeating his famous words of June 18,
1940: "Once again I call all Frenchmen, wherever they are, whatever they
are, to reunite with France. Vive la République! Vive la France!"

The speech had two purposes. It showed that de Gaulle was determined not to give an inch to the rebels, and it reached for the heart of all
patriotic Frenchmen, particularly in the army. The insurrection quickly
died, and no one doubted the connection between its failure and de
Gaulle's performance on television.
The following year, the French voted overwhelmingly in favor of Algerian self-determination. On April 11, 1961, de Gaulle gave a press conference in which he made it clear that France would soon grant the

The Charismatic

country full independence. Eleven days later, French generals in Algeria issued a communique stating that they had taken over the country and declaring a state of siege. This was the most dangerous moment of all: faced
with Algeria's imminent independence, these right-wing generals would go
all the way. A civil war could break out, toppling de Gaulle's government.
The following night, de Gaulle appeared once again on television, once
again wearing his old uniform. He mocked the generals, comparing them
to a South American junta. He talked calmly and sternly. Then, suddenly,
at the very end of the address, his voice rose and even trembled as he called
out to the audience: "Françaises, Français, aidez-moi!" ("Frenchwomen,
Frenchmen, help me!") It was the most stirring moment of all his television appearances. French soldiers in Algeria, listening on transistor radios,
were overwhelmed. The next day they held a mass demonstration in favor
of de Gaulle. Two days later the generals surrendered. On July 1, 1962, de
Gaulle proclaimed Algeria's independence.
In 1940, after the German invasion of France, de Gaulle escaped to England to recruit an army that would eventually return to France for the liberation. At the beginning, he was alone, and his mission seemed hopeless.
But he had the support of Winston Churchill, and with Churchill's blessing
he gave a series of radio talks that the BBC broadcast to France. His
strange, hypnotic voice, with its dramatic tremolos, would enter French living rooms in the evenings. Few of his listeners even knew what he looked
like, but his tone was so confident, so stirring, that he recruited a silent
army of believers. In person, de Gaulle was a strange, brooding man whose
confident manner could just as easily irritate as win over. But over the radio
that voice had intense charisma. De Gaulle was the first great master of
modern media, for he easily transferred his dramatic skills to television,
where his iciness, his calmness, his total self-possession, made audiences feel
both comforted and inspired.
The world has grown more fractured. A nation no longer conies together on the streets or in the squares; it is brought together in living
rooms, where people watching television all over the country can simultaneously be alone and with others. Charisma must now be communicable
over the airwaves or it has no power. But it is in some ways easier to project
on television, both because television makes a direct one-on-one appeal
(the Charismatic seems to address you) and because charisma is fairly easy to
fake for the few moments you spend in front of the camera. As de Gaulle
understood, when appearing on television it is best to radiate calmness and
control, to use dramatic effects sparingly. De Gaulle's overall iciness made
doubly effective the brief moments in which he raised his voice, or let
loose a biting joke. By remaining calm and underplaying it, he hypnotized
his audience. (Your face can express much more if your voice is less strident.) He conveyed emotion visually—the uniform, the setting—and
through the use of certain charged words: the liberation, Joan of Arc. The
less he strained for effect, the more sincere he appeared.

All this must be carefully orchestrated. Punctuate your calmness with
surprises; rise to a climax; keep things short and terse. The only thing that
cannot be faked is self-confidence, the key component to charisma since
the days of Moses. Should the camera lights betray your insecurity, all the
tricks in the world will not put your charisma back together again.

Dangers
n a pleasant May day in 1794, the citizens of Paris gathered in a park
for the Festival of the Supreme Being. The focus of their attention
was Maximilien de Robespierre, head of the Committee of Public Safety,
and the man who had thought up the festival in the first place. The idea was
simple: to combat atheism, "to recognize the existence of a Supreme Being
and the Immortality of the Soul as the guiding forces of the universe."
It was Robespierre's day of triumph. Standing before the masses in his
sky-blue suit and white stockings, he initiated the festivities. The crowd
adored him; after all, he had safeguarded the purposes of the French Revolution through the intense politicking that had followed it. The year before,
he had initiated the Reign of Terror, which cleansed the revolution of its
enemies by sending them to the guillotine. He had also helped guide the
country through a war against the Austrians and the Prussians. What made
crowds, and particularly women, love him was his incorruptible virtue (he
lived very modestly), his refusal to compromise, the passion for the revolution that was evident in everything he did, and the romantic language of
his speeches, which could not fail to inspire. He was a god. The day was
beautiful and augured a great future for the revolution.
Two months later, on July 26, Robespierre delivered a speech that he

O

The Charismatic •

thought would ensure his place in history, for he intended to hint at the
end of the Terror and a new era for France. Rumor also had it that he was
to call for a last handful of people to be sent to the guillotine, a final group
that threatened the safety of the revolution. Mounting the rostrum to address the country's governing convention, Robespierre wore the same
clothes he had worn on the day of the festival. The speech was long, almost
three hours, and included an impassioned description of the values and
virtues he had helped protect. There was also talk of conspiracies, treachery, unnamed enemies.
The response was enthusiastic, but a little less so than usual. The speech
had tired many representatives. Then a lone voice was heard, that of a man
named Bourdon, who spoke against printing Robespierre's speech, a veiled
sign of disapproval. Suddenly others stood up on all sides, and accused him
of vagueness: he had talked of conspiracies and threats without naming the
guilty. Asked to be specific, he refused, preferring to name names later on.
The next day Robespierre stood to defend his speech, and the representatives shouted him down. A few hours later, he was the one sent to the guillotine. On July 28, amid a gathering of citizens who seemed to be in an
even more festive mood than at the Festival of the Supreme Being, Robespierre's head fell into the basket, to resounding cheers. The Reign of Terror was over.
Many of those who seemed to admire Robespierre actually harbored a
gnawing resentment of him—he was so virtuous, so superior, it was oppressive. Some of these men had plotted against him, and were waiting for the
slightest sign of weakness—which appeared on that fateful day when he
gave his last speech. In refusing to name his enemies, he had shown either a
desire to end the bloodshed or a fear that they would strike at him before
he could have them killed. Fed by the conspirators, this one spark turned
into fire. Within two days, first a governing body and then a nation turned
against a Charismatic who two months before had been revered.
Charisma is as volatile as the emotions it stirs. Most often it stirs sentiments of love. But such feelings are hard to maintain. Psychologists talk of
"erotic fatigue"—the moments after love in which you feel tired of it, resentful. Reality creeps in, love turns to hate. Erotic fatigue is a threat to all
Charismatics. The Charismatic often wins love by acting the savior, rescuing people from some difficult circumstance, but once they feel secure,
charisma is less seductive to them. Charismatics need danger and risk. They
are not plodding bureaucrats; some of them deliberately keep danger going, as de Gaulle and Kennedy were wont to do, or as Robespierre did
through the Reign of Terror. But people tire of this, and at your first sign
of weakness they turn on you. The love they showed before will be
matched by their hatred now.
The only defense is to master your charisma. Your passion, your anger,
your confidence make you charismatic, but too much charisma for too
long creates fatigue, and a desire for calmness and order. The better kind of

117

•

The Art of Seduction

charisma is created consciously and is kept under control. When you need
to you can glow with confidence and fervor, inspiring the masses. But
when the adventure is over, you can settle into a routine, turning the heat,
not out, but down. (Robespierre may have been planning that move, but it
came a day too late.) People will admire your self-control and adaptability.
Their love affair with you will move closer to the habitual affection of a
man and wife. You will even have the leeway to look a little boring, a little
simple—a role that can also seem charismatic, if played correctly. Remember: charisma depends on success, and the best way to maintain success, after the initial charismatic rush, is to be practical and even cautious. Mao
Zedong was a distant, enigmatic man who for many had an awe-inspiring
charisma. He suffered many setbacks that would have spelled the end of a
less clever man, but after each reversal he retreated, becoming practical, tolerant, flexible; at least for a while. This protected him from the dangers of a
counterreaction.
There is another alternative: to play the armed prophet. According to
Machiavelli, although a prophet may acquire power through his charismatic
personality, he cannot long survive without the strength to back it up. He
needs an army. The masses will tire of him; they will need to be forced.
Being an armed prophet may not literally involve arms, but it demands a
forceful side to your character, which you can back up with action. Unfortunately this means being merciless with your enemies for as long as you retain power. And no one creates more bitter enemies than the Charismatic.
Finally, there is nothing more dangerous than succeeding a Charismatic.
These characters are unconventional, and their rule is personal in style, being stamped with the wildness of their personalities. They often leave chaos
in their wake. The one who follows after a Charismatic is left with a mess,
which the people, however, do not see. They miss their inspirer and blame
the successor. Avoid this situation at all costs. If it is unavoidable, do not try
to continue what the Charismatic started; go in a new direction. By being
practical, trustworthy, and plain-speaking, you can often generate a strange
kind of charisma through contrast. That was how Harry Truman not only
survived the legacy of Roosevelt but established his own type of charisma.

skillfully carved a snowy

Pygmalion gazed in
wonder, and in his heart
there rose a passionate love
for this image of a human
form. Often he ran his
hands over the work,
feeling it to see whether it
was flesh or ivory, and
would not yet admit that
ivory was all it was. He
kissed the statue, and
imagined that it kissed him
back, spoke to it and
embraced it, and thought
he felt his fingers sink into
the limbs he touched, so
that he was afraid lest a
bruise appear where he had
pressed the flesh.
Sometimes he addressed it
in flattering speeches,
sometimes brought the kind
of presents that girls
enjoy. . . . He dressed the
limbs of his statue in
woman's robes, and put
rings on its fingers, long
necklaces round its
neck. . . . All this finery
became the image well, but
it was no less lovely

then placed the statue on a

The Blue Angel was a huge success in Germany. Audiences were fascinated with Dietrich: that cold, brutal stare as she spread her legs over a
stool, baring her underwear; her effortless way of commanding attention
on screen. Others besides von Sternberg became obsessed with her. A man
dying of cancer, Count Sascha Kolowrat, had one last wish: to see Marlene's legs in person. Dietrich obliged, visiting him in the hospital and lifting up her skirt; he sighed and said "Thank you. Now I can die happy."
Soon Paramount Studios brought Dietrich to Hollywood, where everyone
was quickly talking about her. At a party, all eyes would turn toward her
when she came into the room. She would be escorted by the most handsome men in Hollywood, and would be wearing an outfit both beautiful
and unusual—gold-lame pajamas, a sailor suit with a yachting cap. The
next day the look would be copied by women all over town; next it would
spread to magazines, and a whole new trend would start.
The real object of fascination, however, was unquestionably Dietrich's
face. What had enthralled von Sternberg was her blankness—with a simple
lighting trick he could make that face do whatever he wanted. Dietrich
eventually stopped working with von Sternberg, but never forgot what he
had taught her. One night in 1951, the director Fritz Lang, who was about
to direct her in the film Rancho Notorious, was driving past his office when
he saw a light flash in the window. Fearing a burglary, he got out of his car,
crept up the stairs, and peeked through the crack in the door: it was Dietrich taking pictures of herself in the mirror, studying her face from every
angle.
Marlene Dietrich had a distance from her own self: she could study her
face, her legs, her body, as if she were someone else. This gave her the
ability to mold her look, transforming her appearance for effect. She could
pose in just the way that would most excite a man, her blankness letting
him see her according to his fantasy, whether of sadism, voluptuousness, or
danger. And every man who met her, or who watched her on screen, fantasized endlessly about her. The effect worked on women as well; in the
words of one writer, she projected "sex without gender." But this selfdistance gave her a certain coldness, whether on film or in person. She was
like a beautiful object, something to fetishize and admire the way we admire a work of art.
The fetish is an object that commands an emotional response and that
makes us breathe life into it. Because it is an object we can imagine whatever we want to about it. Most people are too moody, complex, and reactive to let us see them as objects that we can fetishize. The power of the
Fetishistic Star comes from an ability to become an object, and not just any
object but an object we fetishize, one that stimulates a variety of fantasies.
Fetishistic Stars are perfect, like the statue of a Greek god or goddess. The
effect is startling, and seductive. Its principal requirement is self-distance. If
you see yourself as an object, then others will too. An ethereal, dreamlike
air will heighten the effect.

n July 2, 1960, a few weeks before that year's Democratic National
Convention, former President Harry Truman publicly stated that
John F. Kennedy—who had won enough delegates to be chosen his party's
candidate for the presidency—was too young and inexperienced for the
job. Kennedy's response was startling: he called a press conference, to be
televised live, and nationwide, on July 4. The conference's drama was
heightened by the fact that he was away on vacation, so that no one saw or
heard from him until the event itself. Then, at the appointed hour,
Kennedy strode into the conference room like a sheriff entering Dodge
City. He began by stating that he had run in all of the state primaries, at — O V I D , M E T A M O R P H O S E S ,

fairly and squarely. Who was Truman to circumvent the democratic
process? "This is a young country," Kennedy went on, his voice getting

eduction is a form of persuasion that seeks to bypass consciousness, stirring the unconscious mind instead. The reason for this is simple: we are
so surrounded by stimuli that compete for our attention, bombarding us
with obvious messages, and by people who are overtly political and manipulative, that we are rarely charmed or deceived by them. We have grown
increasingly cynical. Try to persuade a person by appealing to their consciousness, by saying outright what you want, by showing all your cards, and
what hope do you have? You are just one more irritation to be tuned out.
To avoid this fate you must learn the art of insinuation, of reaching the
unconscious. The most eloquent expression of the unconscious is the

The count had all the Star qualities. Everything about him was ambiguTHE LIFE, WORLD & FILMS OF

WARHOL ous and open to interpretation. Colorful and vibrant, he stood out from the
crowd. People thought he was immortal, just as a star seems neither to age
nor to disappear. His words were like his presence—fascinating, diverse,
strange, their meaning unclear. Such is the power you can command by
transforming yourself into a glittering object.
Andy Warhol too obsessed everyone who knew him. He had a distinctive style—those silver wigs—and his face was blank and mysterious. People
never knew what he was thinking; like his paintings, he was pure surface.
In the quality of their presence Warhol and Saint-Germain recall the great
trompe l'oeil paintings of the seventeenth century, or the prints of M. C.
Escher—fascinating mixtures of realism and impossibility, which make
people wonder if they are real or imaginary.
A Star must stand out, and this may involve a certain dramatic flair, of
the kind that Dietrich revealed in her appearances at parties. Sometimes,
though, a more haunting, dreamlike effect can be created by subtle touches:
the way you smoke a cigarette, a vocal inflection, a way of walking. It is
often the little things that get under people's skin, and make them imitate
you—the lock of hair over Veronica Lake's right eye, Cary Grant's voice,
Kennedy's ironic smile. Although these nuances may barely register to the
conscious mind, subliminally they can be as attractive as an object with a
striking shape or odd color. Unconsciously we are strangely drawn to
things that have no meaning beyond their fascinating appearance.
Stars make us want to know more about them. You must learn to stir
people's curiosity by letting them glimpse something in your private life,
something that seems to reveal an element of your personality. Let them
fantasize and imagine. A trait that often triggers this reaction is a hint of
spirituality, which can be devilishly seductive, like James Dean's interest in
Eastern philosophy and the occult. Hints of goodness and big-heartedness
can have a similar effect. Stars are like the gods on Mount Olympus, who
live for love and play. The things you love—people, hobbies, animals—
reveal the kind of moral beauty that people like to see in a Star. Exploit this
desire by showing people peeks of your private life, the causes you fight for,
the person you are in love with (for the moment).
Another way Stars seduce is by making us identify with them, giving us
a vicarious thrill. This was what Kennedy did in his press conference about
Truman: in positioning himself as a young man wronged by an older man,
evoking an archetypal generational conflict, he made young people identify
with him. (The popularity in Hollywood movies of the figure of the disaffected, wronged adolescent helped him here.) The key is to represent a

type, as Jimmy Stewart represented the quintessential middle-American,
Cary Grant the smooth aristocrat. People of your type will gravitate to
you, identify with you, share your joy or pain. The attraction must be unconscious, conveyed not in your words but in your pose, your attitude.
Now more than ever, people are insecure, and their identities are in flux.
Help them fix on a role to play in life and they will flock to identify with
you. Simply make your type dramatic, noticeable, and easy to imitate. The
power you have in influencing people's sense of self in this manner is insidious and profound.
Remember: everyone is a public performer. People never know exactly
what you think or feel; they judge you on your appearance. You are an actor. And the most effective actors have an inner distance: like Dietrich, they
can mold their physical presence as if they perceived it from the outside.
This inner distance fascinates us. Stars are playful about themselves, always
adjusting their image, adapting it to the times. Nothing is more laughable
than an image that was fashionable ten years ago but isn't any more. Stars
must always renew their luster or face the worst possible fate: oblivion.

Dangers

S

tars create illusions that are pleasurable to see. The danger is that people
tire of them—the illusion no longer fascinates—and turn to another
Star. Let this happen and you will find it very difficult to regain your place
in the galaxy. You must keep all eyes on you at any cost.
Do not worry about notoriety, or about slurs on your image; we are remarkably forgiving of our Stars. After the death of President Kennedy, all
kinds of unpleasant truths came to light about him—the endless affairs, the
addiction to risk and danger. None of this diminished his appeal, and in
fact the public still considers him one of America's greatest presidents. Errol
Flynn faced many scandals, including a notorious rape case; they only enhanced his rakish image. Once people have recognized a Star, any kind of
publicity, even bad, simply feeds the obsession. Of course you can go too
far: people like a Star to have a transcendent beauty, and too much human
frailty will eventually disillusion them. But bad publicity is less of a danger
than disappearing for too long, or growing too distant. You cannot haunt
people's dreams if they never see you. At the same time, you cannot let the
public get too familiar with you, or let your image become predictable.
People will turn against you in an instant if you begin to bore them, for
boredom is the ultimate social evil.
Perhaps the greatest danger Stars face is the endless attention they elicit.
Obsessive attention can become disconcerting and worse. As any attractive
woman can attest, it is tiring to be gazed at all the time, and the effect can
be destructive, as is shown by the story of Marilyn Monroe. The solution is
to develop the kind of distance from yourself that Dietrich had—take the
attention and idolatry with a grain of salt, and maintain a certain detachment from them. Approach your own image playfully. Most important,
never become obsessed with the obsessive quality of people's interest in you.

Seducers draw
you in by the focused, individualized attention they pay to you. Anti-Seducers
are the opposite: insecure, self-absorbed,
and unable to grasp the psychology of another person, they literally repel. AntiSeducers have no self-awareness, and never
realize when they are pestering, imposing,
talking too much. They lack the subtlety
to create the promise of pleasure that seduction

Typology of the Anti-Seducers
nti-Seducers come in many shapes and kinds, but almost all of them
share a single attribute, the source of their repellence: insecurity. We
are all insecure, and we suffer for it. Yet we are able to surmount these feelings at times; a seductive engagement can bring us out of our usual selfabsorption, and to the degree that we seduce or are seduced, we feel
charged and confident. Anti-Seducers, however, are insecure to such a de- Count Lodovico then

The Art of Seduction

The Brute. If seduction is a kind of ceremony or ritual, part of the pleasure is its duration—the time it takes, the waiting that increases anticipation. Brutes have no patience for such things; they are concerned only with
their own pleasure, never with yours. To be patient is to show that you are
thinking of the other person, which never fails to impress. Impatience has
the opposite effect: assuming you are so interested in them you have no reason to wait, Brutes offend you with their egotism. Underneath that egotism, too, there is often a gnawing sense of inferiority, and if you spurn

ladies began to laugh and
to say that the man
concerned hardly deserved
the name of gentleman;
and many of the men felt
as ashamed as he should
have been, had he ever had
the sense to recognize such
disgraceful behavior for
what it was.

Let us see now how love is
diminished. This happens
through the easy
accessibility of its
consolations, through one's
being able to see and
converse lengthily with a
lover, through a lover's
unsuitable garb and gait,
and by the sudden onset of
poverty. . . . • Another
cause of diminution of love
is the realization of the
notoriety of one's lover, and
accounts of his miserliness,
bad character, and general
wickedness; also any affair
with another woman, even
if it involves no feelings of
love. Love is also
diminished if a woman
realizes that her lover is
foolish and undiscerning, or
if she sees him going too far
in demands of love, giving
no thought to his partner's
modesty nor wishing to
pardon her blushes. A
faithful lover ought to
choose the harshest pains of
love rather than by his
demands cause his partner
embarrassment, or take
pleasure in spurning her
modesty; for one who
thinks only of the outcome
of his own pleasure, and
ignores the welfare of his
partner, should be called a
traitor rather than a lover. •
Love also suffers decrease if
the woman realizes that
her lover is fearful in war,

The Suffocator. Suffocators fall in love with you before you are even halfaware of their existence. The trait is deceptive—you might think they have
found you overwhelming—but the fact is they suffer from an inner void, a
deep well of need that cannot be filled. Never get involved with Suffocators; they are almost impossible to free yourself from without trauma. They
cling to you until you are forced to pull back, whereupon they smother you
with guilt. We tend to idealize a loved one, but love takes time to develop.
Recognize Suffocators by how quickly they adore you. To be so admired
may give a momentary boost to your ego, but deep inside you sense that
their intense emotions are not related to anything you have done. Trust
these instincts.
A subvariant of the Suffocator is the Doormat, a person who slavishly
imitates you. Spot these types early on by seeing whether they are capable
of having an idea of their own. An inability to disagree with you is a bad
sign.

The Moralizer. Seduction is a game, and should be undertaken with a
light heart. All is fair in love and seduction; morality never enters the picture. The character of the Moralizer, however, is rigid. These are people
who follow fixed ideas and try to make you bend to their standards. They
want to change you, to make you a better person, so they endlessly criticize
and judge—that is their pleasure in life. In truth, their moral ideas stem
from their own unhappiness, and mask their desire to dominate those
around them. Their inability to adapt and to enjoy makes them easy to recognize; their mental rigidity may also be accompanied by a physical stiffness. It is hard not to take their criticisms personally so it is better to avoid
their presence and their poisoned comments.

The Tightwad. Cheapness signals more than a problem with money. It is a
sign of something constricted in a person's character—something that
keeps them from letting go or taking a risk. It is the most anti-seductive

The Anti-Seducer •

trait of all, and you cannot allow yourself to give in to it. Most tightwads
do not realize they have a problem; they actually imagine that when they
give someone some paltry crumb, they are being generous. Take a hard
look at yourself—you are probably cheaper than you think. Try giving
more freely of both your money and yourself and you will see the seductive potential in selective generosity. Of course you must keep your generosity under control. Giving too much can be a sign of desperation, as if
you were trying to buy someone.

The Bumbler. Bumblers are self-conscious, and their self-consciousness
heightens your own. At first you may think they are thinking about you,
and so much so that it makes them awkward. In fact they are only thinking
of themselves—worrying about how they look, or about the consequences
for them of their attempt to seduce you. Their worry is usually contagious:
soon you are worrying too, about yourself. Bumblers rarely reach the final
stages of a seduction, but if they get that far, they bungle that too. In seduction, the key weapon is boldness, refusing the target the time to stop
and think. Bumblers have no sense of timing. You might find it amusing
to try to train or educate them, but if they are still Bumblers past a certain
age, the case is probably hopeless—they are incapable of getting outside
themselves.

The Windbag. The most effective seductions are driven by looks, indirect
actions, physical lures. Words have a place, but too much talk will generally
break the spell, heightening surface differences and weighing things down.
People who talk a lot most often talk about themselves. They have never
acquired that inner voice that wonders, Am I boring you? To be a Windbag
is to have a deep-rooted selfishness. Never interrupt or argue with these
types—that only fuels their windbaggery. At all costs learn to control your
own tongue.

The Reactor. Reactors are far too sensitive, not to you but to their own
egos. They comb your every word and action for signs of a slight to their
vanity. If you strategically back off, as you sometimes must in seduction,
they will brood and lash out at you. They are prone to whining and complaining, two very anti-seductive traits. Test them by telling a gentle joke or
story at their expense: we should all be able to laugh at ourselves a little, but
the Reactor cannot. You can read the resentment in their eyes. Erase any
reactive qualities in your own character—they unconsciously repel people.

The Vulgarian. Vulgarians are inattentive to the details that are so important in seduction. You can see this in their personal appearance—their

know that it is sometimes better to control oneself and refuse to give in to
one's impulses. Vulgarians will blab, saying anything in public. They have
no sense of timing and are rarely in harmony with your tastes. Indiscretion
is a sure sign of the Vulgarian (talking to others of your affair, for example);
it may seem impulsive, but its real source is their radical selfishness, their inability to see themselves as others see them. More than just avoiding Vulgarians, you must make yourself their opposite—tact, style, and attention to
detail are all basic requirements of a seducer.

Examples of the Anti-Seducer

1. Claudius, the step-grandson of the great Roman emperor Augustus, was
considered something of an imbecile as a young man, and was treated badly
by almost everyone in his family. His nephew Caligula, who became emperor in A.D. 37, made it a sport to torture him, making him run around
the palace at top speed as penance for his stupidity, having soiled sandals
tied to his hands at supper, and so on. As Claudius grew older, he seemed
to become even more slow-witted, and while all of his relatives lived under
the constant threat of assassination, he was left alone. So it came as a great
surprise to everyone, including Claudius himself, that when, in A.D. 41, a
cabal of soldiers assassinated Caligula, they also proclaimed Claudius emperor. Having no desire to rule, he delegated most of the governing to
confidantes (a group of freed slaves) and spent his time doing what he loved
best: eating, drinking, gambling, and whoring.
Claudius's wife, Valeria Messalina, was one of the most beautiful
women in Rome. Although he seemed fond of her, Claudius paid her no
attention, and she started to have affairs. At first she was discreet, but over
the years, provoked by her husband's neglect, she became more and more
debauched. She had a room built for her in the palace where she entertained scores of men, doing her best to imitate the most notorious prosti— O V I D , THE ART OF LOVE,
tute in Rome, whose name was written on the door. Any man who refused

her advances was put to death. Almost everyone in Rome knew about
these frolics, but Claudius said nothing; he seemed oblivious.
So great was Messalina's passion for her favorite lover, Gaius Silius, that
she decided to marry him, although both of them were married already.
While Claudius was away, they held a wedding ceremony, authorized by a
marriage contract that Claudius himself had been tricked into signing. After the ceremony, Gaius moved into the palace. Now the shock and disgust
of the whole city finally forced Claudius into action, and he ordered the
execution of Gaius and of Messalina's other lovers—but not of Messalina
herself. Nevertheless, a gang of soldiers, inflamed by the scandal, hunted
her down and stabbed her to death. When this was reported to the emperor, he merely ordered more wine and continued his meal. Several nights

The Anti-Seducer

later, to the amazement of his slaves, he asked why the empress was not
joining him for dinner.
Nothing is more infuriating than being paid no attention. In the process of
seduction, you may have to pull back at times, subjecting your target to
moments of doubt. But prolonged inattention will not only break the seductive spell, it can create hatred. Claudius was an extreme of this behavior.
His insensitivity was created by necessity: in acting like an imbecile, he hid
his ambition and protected himself among dangerous competitors. But the
insensitivity became second nature. Claudius grew slovenly, and no longer
noticed what was going on around him. His inattentiveness had a profound
effect on his wife: How, she wondered, can a man, especially a physically
unappealing man like Claudius, not notice me, or care about my affairs
with other men? But nothing she did seemed to matter to him.
Claudius marks the extreme, but the spectrum of inattention is wide. A
lot of people pay too little attention to the details, the signals another person gives. Their senses are dulled by work, by hardship, by self-absorption.
We often see this turning off the seductive charge between two people, notably between couples who have been together for years. Carried further, it
will stir angry, bitter feelings. Often, the one who has been cheated on by a
partner started the dynamic by patterns of inattention.

2. In 1639, a French army besieged and took possession of the Italian city of
Turin. Two French officers, the Chevalier (later Count) de Grammont and
his friend Matta, decided to turn their attention to the city's beautiful
women. The wives of some of Turin's most illustrious men were more than
susceptible—their husbands were busy, and kept mistresses of their own. The
wives' only requirement was that the suitor play by the rules of gallantry.
The chevalier and Matta were quick to find partners, the chevalier
choosing the beautiful Mademoiselle de Saint-Germain, who was soon to
be betrothed, and Matta offering his services to an older and more experienced woman, Madame de Senantes. The chevalier took to wearing green,
Matta blue, these being their ladies' favorite colors. On the second day of
their courtships the couples visited a palace outside the city. The chevalier
was all charm, making Mademoiselle de Saint-Germain laugh uproariously
at his witticisms, but Matta did not fare so well; he had no patience for this
gallantry business, and when he and Madame de Senantes took a stroll, he
squeezed her hand and boldly declared his affections. The lady of course
was aghast, and when they got back to Turin she left without looking at
him. Unaware that he had offended her, Matta imagined that she was overcome with emotion, and felt rather pleased with himself. But the Chevalier
de Grammont, wondering why the pair had parted, visited Madame de
Senantes and asked her how it went. She told him the truth—Matta had
dispensed with the formalities and was ready to bed her. The chevalier

Just as ladies do love men
which be valiant and bold

they love such as be of like

which is cowardly and over

them, will never win their
good favor. Not that they
would have them so
overweening, bold, and
presumptuous, as that they
should by main force lay
them on the floor; but
rather they desire in them a
certain hardy modesty, or
perhaps better a certain
modest hardihood. For
while themselves are not
exactly wantons, and will
neither solicit a man nor

comrades, for the which two
very honorable ladies, and
of by no means humble
quality, made tryst one day
at Paris to go walking in a

laughed and thought to himself how differently he would manage affairs if
he were the one wooing the lovely Madame.
Over the next few days Matta continued to misread the signs. He did
not pay a visit to Madame de Senantes's husband, as custom required. He
did not wear her colors. When the two went riding together, he went chasing after hares, as if they were the more interesting prey, and when he took
snuff he failed to offer her some. Meanwhile he continued to make his
overforward advances. Finally Madame had had enough, and complained to
him directly. Matta apologized; he had not realized his errors. Moved by his
apology, the lady was more than ready to resume the courtship—but a few
days later, after a few trifling stabs at wooing, Matta once again assumed
that she was ready for bed. To his dismay, she refused him as before. "I do
not think that [women] can be mightily offended," Matta told the chevalier, "if one sometimes leaves off trifling, to come to the point." But
Madame de Senantes would have nothing more to do with him, and the
Chevalier de Grammont, seeing an opportunity he could not pass by, took
advantage of her displeasure by secretly courting her properly, and eventually winning the favors that Matta had tried to force.
There is nothing more anti-seductive than feeling that someone has assumed
that you are theirs, that you cannot possibly resist them. The slightest appearance of this kind of conceit is deadly to seduction; you must prove
yourself, take your time, win your target's heart. Perhaps you fear that he or
she will be offended by a slower pace, or will lose interest. It is more likely,
however, that your fear reflects your own insecurity, and insecurity is always
anti-seductive. In truth, the longer you take, the more you show the depth
of your interest, and the deeper the spell you create.
In a world of few formalities and ceremony, seduction is one of the few
remnants from the past that retains the ancient patterns. It is a ritual, and its
rites must be observed. Haste reveals not the depth of your feelings but the
degree of your self-absorption. It may be possible sometimes to hurry
someone into love, but you will only be repaid by the lack of pleasure this
kind of love affords. If you are naturally impetuous, do what you can to
disguise it. Strangely enough, the effort you spend on holding yourself
back may be read by your target as deeply seductive.

3. In Paris in the 1730s lived a young man named Meilcour, who was just
of an age to have his first affair. His mother's friend Madame de Lursay, a
widow of around forty, was beautiful and charming, but had a reputation
for being untouchable; as a boy, Meilcour had been infatuated with her, but
never expected his love would be returned. So it was with great surprise
and excitement that he realized that now that he was old enough, Madame
de Lursay's tender looks seemed to indicate a more than motherly interest
in him.

how it had fared with each.
Then the one which was

because sexuality is repressed and requires speaking in code. It is rather because wordless communication (through clothes, gestures, actions) is the
most pleasurable, exciting, and seductive form of language.
In Crébillon fils's novel, Madame de Lursay is an ingenious seductress
who finds it exciting to initiate young men. But even she cannot overcome
the youthful stupidity of Meilcour, who is incapable of reading her signs
because he is absorbed in his own thoughts. Later in the story, she does
manage to educate him, but in real life there are many who cannot be
educated. They are too literal and insensitive to the details that contain
seductive power. They do not so much repel as irritate and infuriate you
by their constant misinterpretations, always viewing life from behind
the screen of their ego and unable to see things as they really are. Meilcour
is so caught up in himself he cannot see that Madame is expecting him to
make the bold move to which she will have to succumb. His hesitation
shows that he is thinking of himself, not of her; that he is worrying about
how he will look, not feeling overwhelmed by her charms. Nothing could
be more anti-seductive. Recognize such types, and if they are past the
young age that would give them an excuse, do not entangle yourself in
their awkwardness—they will infect you with doubt.

4. In the Heian court of late-tenth-century Japan, the young nobleman
Kaoru, purported son of the great seducer Genji himself, had had nothing
but misfortune in love. He had become infatuated with a young princess,
Oigimi, who lived in a dilapidated home in the countryside, her father
— S E I G N E U R DE BRANTÔME,
LIVES OF FAIR & GALLANT having fallen on hard times. Then one day he had an encounter with
LADIES, TRANSLATED BY A. R..
Oigimi's sister, Nakanokimi, that convinced him she was the one he actuALLINSON
ally loved. Confused, he returned to court, and did not visit the sisters for
some time. Then their father died, followed shortly thereafter by Oigimi
herself.
Now Kaoru realized his mistake: he had loved Oigimi all along, and she
had died out of despair that he did not care for her. He would never meet
her like again; she was all he could think about. When Nakanokimi, her father and sister dead, came to live at court, Kaoru had the house where
Oigimi and her family had lived turned into a shrine.
One day, Nakanokimi, seeing the melancholy into which Kaoru had
fallen, told him that there was a third sister, Ukifune, who resembled his
beloved Oigimi and lived hidden away in the countryside. Kaoru came to
life—perhaps he had a chance to redeem himself, to change the past. But
how could he meet this woman? There came a time when he visited the
shrine to pay his respects to the departed Oigimi, and heard that the mysterious Ukifune was there as well. Agitated and excited, he managed to catch
a glimpse of her through the crack in a door. The sight of her took his
breath away: although she was a plain-looking country girl, in Kaoru's eyes
she was the living incarnation of Oigimi. Her voice, meanwhile, was like

The

the voice of Nakanokimi, whom he had loved as well. Tears welled up in
his eyes.
A few months later Kaoru managed to find the house in the mountains
where Ukifune lived. He visited her there, and she did not disappoint. "I
once had a glimpse of you through a crack in a door," he told her, and
"you have been very much on my mind ever since." Then he picked her up
in his arms and carried her to a waiting carriage. He was taking her back to
the shrine, and the journey there brought back to him the image of
Oigimi; again his eyes clouded with tears. Looking at Ukifune, he silently
compared her to Oigimi—her clothes were less nice but she had beautiful
hair.
When Oigimi was alive, she and Kaoru had played the koto together,
so once at the shrine he had kotos brought out. Ukifune did not play as
well as Oigimi had, and her manners were less refined. Not to worry—he
would give her lessons, change her into a lady. But then, as he had done
with Oigimi, Kaoru returned to court, leaving Ukifune languishing at the
shrine. Some time passed before he visited her again; she had improved,
was more beautiful than before, but he could not stop thinking of Oigimi.
Once again he left her, promising to bring her to court, but more weeks
passed, and finally he received the news that Ukifune had disappeared, last
seen heading toward a river. She had most likely committed suicide.
At the funeral ceremony for Ukifune, Kaoru was wracked with guilt:
why had he not come for her earlier? She deserved a better fate.
Kaoru and the others appear in the eleventh-century Japanese novel The
Tale of Genji, by the noblewoman Murasaki Shikibu. The characters are
based on people the author knew, but Kaoru's type appears in every culture
and period: these are men and women who seem to be searching for an
ideal partner. The one they have is never quite right; at first glance a person
excites them, but they soon see faults, and when a new person crosses their
path, he or she looks better and the first person is forgotten. These types
often try to work on the imperfect mortal who has excited them, to improve them culturally and morally. But this proves extremely unsatisfactory
for both parties.
The truth about this type is not that they are searching for an ideal
but that they are hopelessly unhappy with themselves. You may mistake
their dissatisfaction for a perfectionist's high standards, but in point of fact
nothing will really satisfy them, for their unhappiness is deep-rooted. You
can recognize them by their past, which will be littered with short-lived,
stormy romances. Also, they will tend to compare you to others, and to try
to remake you. You may not realize at first what you have gotten into, but
people like this will eventually prove hopelessly anti-seductive because they
cannot see your individual qualities. Cut the romance off before it happens.
These types are closet sadists and will torture you with their unreachable
goals.

The Art of Seduction

5. In 1762, in the city of Turin, Italy, Giovanni Giacomo Casanova made
the acquaintance of one Count A.B., a Milanese gentleman who seemed to
like him enormously. The count had fallen on hard times and Casanova
lent him some money. In gratitude, the count invited Casanova to stay with
him and his wife in Milan. His wife, he said, was from Barcelona, and was
admired far and wide for her beauty. He showed Casanova her letters,
which had an intriguing wit; Casanova imagined her as a prize worth seducing. He went to Milan.
Arriving at the house of Count A.B., Casanova found that the Spanish
lady was certainly beautiful, but that she was also quiet and serious. Something about her bothered him. As he was unpacking his clothes, the countess saw a stunning red dress, trimmed with sable, among his belongings. It
was a gift, Casanova explained, for any Milanese lady who won his heart.
The following evening at dinner, the countess was suddenly more
friendly, teasing and bantering with Casanova. She described the dress as a
bribe—he would use it to persuade a woman to give in to him. On the
contrary, said Casanova, he only gave gifts afterward, as tokens of his appreciation. That evening, in a carriage on the way back from the opera, she
asked him if a wealthy friend of hers could buy the dress, and when he said
no, she was clearly vexed. Sensing her game, Casanova offered to give her
the sable dress if she was kind to him. This only made her angry, and they
quarreled.
Finally Casanova had had enough of the countess's moods: he sold the
dress for 15,000 francs to her wealthy friend, who in turn gave it to her, as
she had planned all along. But to prove his lack of interest in money,
Casanova told the countess he would give her the 15,000 francs, no strings
attached. "You are a very bad man," she said, "but you can stay, you amuse
me." She resumed her coquettish manner, but Casanova was not fooled. "It
is not my fault, madame, if your charms have so little power over me," he
told her. "Here are 15,000 francs to console you." He laid the money on a
table and walked out, leaving the countess fuming and vowing revenge.
When Casanova first met the Spanish lady, two things about her repelled
him. First, her pride: rather than engaging in the give-and-take of seduction, she demanded a man's subjugation. Pride can reflect self-assurance,
signaling that you will not abase yourself before others. Just as often,
though, it stems from an inferiority complex, which demands that others
abase themselves before you. Seduction requires an openness to the other
person, a willingness to bend and adapt. Excessive pride, without anything
to justify it, is highly anti-seductive.
The second quality that disgusted Casanova was the countess's greed:
her coquettish little games were designed only to get the dress—she had no
interest in romance. For Casanova, seduction was a lighthearted game that
people played for their mutual amusement. In his scheme of things, it was
fine if a woman wanted money and gifts as well; he could understand that
desire, and he was a generous man. But he also felt that this was a desire a

woman should disguise—she should create the impression that what she
was after was pleasure. The person who is obviously angling for money or
other material reward can only repel. If that is your intention, if you are
looking for something other than pleasure—for money, for power—never
show it. The suspicion of an ulterior motive is anti-seductive. Never let
anything break the illusion.

6. In 1868, Queen Victoria of England hosted her first private meeting
with the country's new prime minister, William Gladstone. She had met
him before, and knew his reputation as a moral absolutist, but this was to be
a ceremony, an exchange of pleasantries. Gladstone, however, had no patience for such things. At that first meeting he explained to the queen his
theory of royalty: the queen, he believed, had to play an exemplary role
in England—a role she had lately failed to live up to, for she was overly
private.
This lecture set a bad tone for the future, and things only got worse:
soon Victoria was receiving letters from Gladstone, addressing the subject
in even greater depth. Half of them she never bothered to read, and soon
she was doing everything she could to avoid contact with the leader of her
government; if she had to see him, she made the meeting as brief as possible. To that end, she never allowed him to sit down in her presence, hoping
that a man his age would soon tire and leave. For once he got going on a
subject dear to his heart, he did not notice your look of disinterest or the
tears in your eyes from yawning. His memoranda on even the simplest of
issues would have to be translated into plain English for her by a member of
her staff. Worst of all, Gladstone argued with her, and his arguments had a
way of making her feel stupid. She soon learned to nod her head and appear to agree with whatever abstract point he was trying to make. In a letter to her secretary, referring to herself in the third person, she wrote, "She
always felt in [Gladstone's] manner an overbearing obstinacy and imperiousness . . . which she never experienced from anyone else, and which she
found most disagreeable." Over the years, these feelings hardened into an
unwaning hatred.
As the head of the Liberal Party, Gladstone had a nemesis, Benjamin
Disraeli, the head of the Conservative Party. He considered Disraeli amoral,
a devilish Jew. At one session of Parliament, Gladstone tore into his rival,
scoring point after point as he described where his opponents policies
would lead. Growing angry as he spoke (as usually happened when he
talked of Disraeli), he pounded the speaker's table with such force that pens
and papers went flying. Through all of this Disraeli seemed half-asleep.
When Gladstone had finished, he opened his eyes, rose to his feet, and
calmly walked up to the table. "The right honorable gentleman," he said,
"has spoken with much passion, much eloquence, and much—ahem—
violence." Then, after a drawn-out pause, he continued, "But the damage
can be repaired"—and he proceeded to gather up everything that had fallen

143

•

The Art of Seduction

from the table and put them back in place. The speech that followed was all
the more masterful for its calm and ironic contrast to Gladstone's. The
members of Parliament were spellbound, and all of them agreed he had
won the day.
If Disraeli was the consummate social seducer and charmer, Gladstone was
the Anti-Seducer. Of course he had supporters, mostly among the more
puritanical elements of society—he twice defeated Disraeli in a general
election. But he found it hard to broaden his appeal beyond the circle of
believers. Women in particular found him insufferable. Of course they had
no vote at the time, so they were little political liability; but Gladstone had
no patience for a feminine point of view. A woman, he felt, had to learn to
see things as a man did, and it was his purpose in life to educate those he
felt were irrational or abandoned by God.
It did not take long for Gladstone to wear on anyone's nerves. That is
the nature of people who are convinced of some truth, but have no patience for a different perspective or for dealing with someone else's psychology. These types are bullies, and in the short term they often get their
way, particularly among the less aggressive. But they stir up a lot of resentment and unspoken antipathy, which eventually trips them up. People see
through their righteous moral stance, which is most often a cover for a
power play—morality is a form of power. A seducer never seeks to persuade directly, never parades his or her morality, never lectures or imposes.
Everything is subtle, psychological, and indirect.

Symbol: The
Crab. In a harsh world, the crab survives by its hardened shell, by the threat of its
pincers, and by burrowing into the sand. No one dares
get too close. But the Crab cannot surprise its enemy and has
little mobility. Its defensive strength is its supreme limitation.

Uses of Anti-Seduction

T

he best way to avoid entanglements with Anti-Seducers is to recognize
them right away and give them a wide berth, but they often deceive
us. Involvements with these types are painful, and are hard to disengage
from, because the more emotional response you show, the more engaged
you seem to be. Do not get angry—that may only encourage them or
exacerbate their anti-seductive tendencies. Instead, act distant and indifferent, pay no attention to them, make them feel how little they matter to
you. The best antidote to an Anti-Seducer is often to be anti-seductive
yourself.
Cleopatra had a devastating effect on every man who crossed her path.
Octavius—the future Emperor Augustus, and the man who would defeat and destroy Cleopatra's lover Mark Antony—was well aware of her
power, and defended himself against it by being always extremely amiable
with her, courteous to the extreme, but never showing the slightest emotion, whether of interest or dislike. In other words, he treated her as if she
were any other woman. Facing this front, she could not sink her hooks into
him. Octavius made anti-seduction his defense against the most irresistible
woman in history. Remember: seduction is a game of attention, of slowly
filling the other person's mind with your presence. Distance and inattention
will create the opposite effect, and can be used as a tactic when the need
arises.
Finally, if you really want to "anti-seduce," simply feign the qualities
listed at the beginning of the chapter. Nag; talk a lot, particularly about
yourself; dress against the other person's tastes; pay no attention to detail;
suffocate, and so on. A word of warning: with the arguing type, the Windbag, never talk back too much. Words will only fan the flames. Adopt the
Queen Victoria strategy: nod, seem to agree, then find an excuse to cut the
conversation short. This is the only defense.

The Eighteen Types
The people around you are all potential victims of a
seduction, but first you must know what type of victim you are dealing with. Victims are categorized
by what they feel they are missing in life—adventure, attention, romance, a naughty experience, mental or physical stimulation, etc.
Once you identify their type, you have
the necessary ingredients for a seduction: you will be the one to give
them what they lack and cannot
get on their own. In studying
potential victims, learn to see
the reality behind the appearance. A timid person
may yearn to play the
star; a prude may
long for a transgressive

thrill.

Never try to
seduce your

Victim Theory

N

obody in this world feels whole and complete. We all sense some gap
in our character, something we need or want but cannot get on our
own. When we fall in love, it is often with someone who seems to fill that
gap. The process is usually unconscious and depends on luck: we wait for
the right person to cross our path, and when we fall for them we hope they
return our love. But the seducer does not leave such things to chance.
Look at the people around you. Forget their social exterior, their obvious character traits; look behind all of that, focusing on the gaps, the missing pieces in their psyche. That is the raw material of any seduction. Pay
close attention to their clothes, their gestures, their offhand comments, the
things in their house, certain looks in their eyes; get them to talk about
their past, particularly past romances. And slowly the outline of those missing pieces will come into view. Understand: people are constantly giving
out signals as to what they lack. They long for completeness, whether the
illusion of it or the reality, and if it has to come from another person, that
person has tremendous power over them. We may call them victims of a
seduction, but they are almost always willing victims.
This chapter outlines the eighteen types of victims, each one of which
has a dominant lack. Although your target may well reveal the qualities of
more than one type, there is usually a common need that ties them together. Perhaps you see someone as both a New Prude and a Crushed Star,
but what is common to both is a feeling of repression, and therefore a desire to be naughty, along with a fear of not being able or daring enough. In
identifying your victim's type, be careful to not be taken in by outward appearances. Both deliberately and unconsciously, we often develop a social
exterior designed specifically to disguise our weaknesses and lacks. For instance, you may think you are dealing with someone who is tough and
cynical, without realizing that deep inside they have a soft sentimental core.
They secretly pine for romance. And unless you identify their type and the
emotions beneath their toughness, you lose the chance to truly seduce
them. Most important: expunge the nasty habit of thinking that other people have the same lacks you do. You may crave comfort and security, but in
giving comfort and security to someone else, on the assumption they must
want them as well, you are more likely smothering and pushing them away.
Never try to seduce someone who is of your own type. You will be like
two puzzles missing the same parts.

The Art of Seduction

The Eighteen Types
The Reformed Rake or Siren. People of this type were once happy-golucky seducers who had their way with the opposite sex. But the day came
when they were forced to give this up—someone corraled them into a relationship, they were encountering too much social hostility, they were getting older and decided to settle down. Whatever the reason, you can be
sure they feel some resentment and a sense of loss, as if a limb were missing. We are always trying to recapture pleasures we experienced in the past,
but the temptation is particularly great for the Reformed Rake or Siren because the pleasures they found in seduction were intense. These types are
ripe for the picking: all that is required is that you cross their path and offer
them the opportunity to resume their rakish or siren ways. Their blood will
stir and the call of their youth will overwhelm them.
It is critical, though, to give these types the illusion that they are the
ones doing the seducing. With the Reformed Rake, you must spark his interest indirectly, then let him burn and glow with desire. With the Reformed Siren, you want to give her the impression that she still has the
irresistible power to draw a man in and make him give up everything for
her. Remember that what you are offering these types is not another relationship, another constriction, but rather the chance to escape the corral
and have some ran. Do not be put off if they are in a relationship; a preexisting commitment is often the perfect foil. If hooking them into a relationship is what you want, hide it as best you can and realize it may not be
possible. The Rake or Siren is unfaithful by nature; your ability to spark the
old feeling gives you power, but then you will have to live with the consequences of their feckless ways.

The Disappointed Dreamer. As children, these types probably spent a lot
of time alone. To entertain themselves they developed a powerful fantasy
life, fed by books and films and other kinds of popular culture. And as they
get older, it becomes increasingly difficult to reconcile their fantasy life
with reality, and so they are often disappointed by what they get. This is
particularly true in relationships. They have been dreaming of romantic heroes, of danger and excitement, but what they have is lovers with human
frailties, the petty weaknesses of everyday life. As the years pass, they may
force themselves to compromise, because otherwise they would have to
spend their lives alone; but beneath the surface they are bitter and still hungering for something grand and romantic.
You can recognize this type by the books they read and films they go to,
the way their ears prick up when told of the real-life adventures some people manage to live out. In their clothes and home furnishings, a taste for
exuberant romance or drama will peek through. They are often trapped in
drab relationships, and little comments here and there will reveal their disappointment and inner tension.

The Seducer's Victims—The Eighteen Types

These types make for excellent and satisfying victims. First, they usually
have a great deal of pent-up passion and energy, which you can release and
focus on yourself. They also have great imaginations and will respond to
anything vaguely mysterious or romantic that you offer them. All you need
do is disguise some of your less than exalted qualities and give them a part
of their dream. This could be the chance to live out their adventures or be
courted by a chivalrous soul. If you give them a part of what they want
they will imagine the rest. At all cost, do not let reality break the illusion
you are creating. One moment of pettiness and they will be gone, more
bitterly disappointed than ever.

The Pampered Royal. These people were the classic spoiled children. All
of their wants and desires were met by an adoring parent—endless entertainments, a parade of toys, whatever kept them happy for a day or two.
Where many children learn to entertain themselves, inventing games and
finding friends, Pampered Royals are taught that others will do the entertaining for them. Being spoiled, they get lazy, and as they get older and the
parent is no longer there to pamper them, they tend to feel quite bored and
restless. Their solution is to find pleasure in variety, to move quickly from
person to person, job to job, or place to place before boredom sets in. They
do not settle into relationships well because habit and routine of some kind
are inevitable in such affairs. But their ceaseless search for variety is tiring
for them and comes with a price: work problems, strings of unsatisfying romances, friends scattered across the globe. Do not mistake their restlessness
and infidelity for reality—what the Pampered Prince or Princess is really
looking for is one person, that parental figure, who will give them the
spoiling they crave.
To seduce this type, be ready to provide a lot of distraction—new
places to visit, novel experiences, color, spectacle. You will have to maintain an air of mystery, continually surprising your target with a new side to
your character. Variety is the key. Once Pampered Royals are hooked,
things get easier for they will quickly grow dependent on you and you can
put out less effort. Unless their childhood pampering has made them too
difficult and lazy, these types make excellent victims——they will be as loyal
to you as they once were to mommy or daddy. But you will have to do
much of the work. If you are after a long relationship, disguise it. Offer
long-term security to a Pampered Royal and you will induce a panicked
flight. Recognize these types by the turmoil in their past—job changes,
travel, short-term relationships—and by the air of aristocracy, no matter
their social class, that comes from once being treated like royalty.

The New Prude. Sexual prudery still exists, but it is less common than it
was. Prudery, however, is never just about sex; a prude is someone who is
excessively concerned with appearances, with what society considers ap-

• 151

152

• The Art of Seduction

propriate and acceptable behavior. Prudes rigorously stay within the boundaries of correctness because more than anything they fear society's judgment. Seen in this light, prudery is just as prevalent as it always was.
The New Prude is excessively concerned with standards of goodness,
fairness, political sensitivity, tastefulness, etc. What marks the New Prude,
though, as well as the old one, is that deep down they are actually excited
and intrigued by guilty, transgressive pleasures. Frightened by this attraction, they run in the opposite direction and become the most correct of all.
They tend to wear drab colors; they certainly never take fashion risks. They
can be very judgmental and critical of people who do take risks and are less
correct. They are also addicted to routine, which gives them a way to tamp
down their inner turmoil.
New Prudes are secretly oppressed by their correctness and long to
transgress. Just as sexual prudes make prime targets for a Rake or Siren, the
New Prude will often be most tempted by someone with a dangerous or
naughty side. If you desire a New Prude, do not be taken in by their judgments of you or their criticisms. That is only a sign of how deeply you fascinate them; you are on their mind. You can often draw a New Prude into
a seduction, in fact, by giving them the chance to criticize you or even try
to reform you. Take nothing of what they say to heart, of course, but now
you have the perfect excuse to spend time with them—and New Prudes
can be seduced simply through being in contact with you. These types actually make excellent and rewarding victims. Once you open them up and
get them to let go of their correctness, they are flooded with feelings and
energies. They may even overwhelm you. Perhaps they are in a relationship
with someone as drab as they themselves seem to be—do not be put off.
They are simply asleep, waiting to be awakened.

The Crushed Star. We all want attention, we all want to shine, but with
most of us these desires are fleeting and easily quieted. The problem with
Crushed Stars is that at one point in their lives they did find themselves the
center of attention—perhaps they were beautiful, charming and effervescent, perhaps they were athletes, or had some other talent—but those days
are gone. They may seem to have accepted this, but the memory of having
once shone is hard to get over. In general, the appearance of wanting attention, of trying to stand out, is not seen too kindly in polite society or in the
workplace. So to get along, Crushed Stars learn to tamp down their desires;
but failing to get the attention they feel they deserve, they also become resentful. You can recognize Crushed Stars by certain unguarded moments:
they suddenly receive some attention in a social setting, and it makes them
glow; they mention their glory days, and there is a little glint in the eye; a
little wine in the system, and they become effervescent.
Seducing this type is simple: just make them the center of attention.
When you are with them, act as if they were stars and you were basking in
their glow. Get them to talk, particularly about themselves. In social situa-

The Seducer's Victims—The Eighteen Types •

tions, mute your own colors and let them look funny and radiant by comparison. In general, play the Charmer. The reward of seducing Crushed
Stars is that you stir up powerful emotions. They will feel intensely grateful
to you for letting them shine. To whatever extent they had felt crushed and
bottled up, the easing of that pain releases intensity and passion, all directed
at you. They will fall madly in love. If you yourself have any star or dandy
tendencies it is wise to avoid such victims. Sooner or later those tendencies
will come out, and the competition between you will be ugly.

The Novice. What separates Novices from ordinary innocent young people is that they are fatally curious. They have little or no experience of the
world, but have been exposed to it secondhand—in newspapers, films,
books. Finding their innocence a burden, they long to be initiated into the
ways of the world. Everyone sees them as so sweet and innocent, but they
know this isn't so—they cannot be as angelic as people think them.
Seducing a Novice is easy. To do it well, however, requires a bit of art.
Novices are interested in people with experience, particularly people with
a touch of corruption and evil. Make that touch too strong, though, and it
will intimidate and frighten them. What works best with a Novice is a mix
of qualities. You are somewhat childlike yourself, with a playful spirit. At
the same time, it is clear that you have hidden depths, even sinister ones.
(This was the secret of Lord Byron's success with so many innocent
women.) You are initiating your Novices not just sexually but experientially, exposing them to new ideas, taking them to new places, new worlds
both literal and metaphoric. Do not make your seduction ugly or seedy—
everything must be romantic, even including the evil and dark side of life.
Young people have their ideals; it is best to initiate them with an aesthetic
touch. Seductive language works wonders on Novices, as does attention to
detail. Spectacles and colorful events appeal to their sensitive senses. They
are easily misled by these tactics, because they lack the experience to see
through them.
Sometimes Novices are a little older and have been at least somewhat
educated in the ways of the world. Yet they put on a show of innocence,
for they see the power it has over older people. These are coy Novices,
aware of the game they are playing—but Novices they remain. They may
be less easily misled than purer Novices, but the way to seduce them is
pretty much the same—mix innocence and corruption and you will fascinate them.

The Conqueror. These types have an unusual amount of energy, which
they find difficult to control. They are always on the prowl for people to
conquer, obstacles to surmount. You will not always recognize Conquerors
by their exterior—they can seem a little shy in social situations and can
have a degree of reserve. Look not at their words or appearance but at their

153

154

•

The Art of Seduction

actions, in work and in relationships. They love power, and by hook or by
crook they get it.
Conquerors tend to be emotional, but their emotion only comes out in
outbursts, when pushed. In matters of romance, the worst thing you can do
with them is lie down and make yourself easy prey; they may take advantage of your weakness, but they will quickly discard you and leave you the
worse for wear. You want to give Conquerors a chance to be aggressive, to
overcome some resistance or obstacle, before letting them think they have
overwhelmed you. You want to give them a good chase. Being a little difficult or moody, using coquetry, will often do the trick. Do not be intimidated by their aggressiveness and energy—that is precisely what you can
turn to your advantage. To break them in, keep them charging back and
forth like a bull. Eventually they will grow weak and dependent, as
Napoleon became the slave of Josephine.
The Conqueror is generally male but there are plenty of female Conquerors out there—Lou Andreas-Salomé and Natalie Barney are famous
ones. Female Conquerors will succumb to coquetry, though, just as the
male ones will.

The Exotic Fetishist. Most of us are excited and intrigued by the exotic.
What separates Exotic Fetishists from the rest of us is the degree of this interest, which seems to govern all their choices in life. In truth they feel
empty inside and have a strong dose of self-loathing. They do not like
wherever it is they come from, their social class (usually middle or upper),
and their culture because they do not like themselves.
These types are easy to recognize. They like to travel; their houses are
filled with objets from faraway places; they fetishize the music or art of this
or that foreign culture. They often have a strong rebellious streak. Clearly
the way to seduce them is to position yourself as exotic—if you do not at
least appear to come from a different background or race, or to have some
alien aura, you should not even bother. But it is always possible to play up
what makes you exotic, to make it a kind of theater for their amusement.
Your clothes, the things you talk about, the places you take them, make a
show of your difference. Exaggerate a little and they will imagine the rest,
because such types tend to be self-deluders. Exotic Fetishists, however, do
not make particularly good victims. Whatever exoticism you have will soon
seem banal to them, and they will want something else. It will be a struggle
to hold their interest. Their underlying insecurity will also keep you on
edge.
One variation on this type is the man or woman who is trapped in a
stultifying relationship, a banal occupation, a dead-end town. It is circumstance, as opposed to personal neurosis, that makes such people fetishize the
exotic; and these Exotic Fetishists are better victims than the self-loathing
kind, because you can offer them a temporary escape from whatever op-

presses them. Nothing, however, will offer true Exotic Fetishists escape
from themselves.

The Drama Queen. There are people who cannot do without some constant drama in their lives—it is their way of deflecting boredom. The greatest mistake you can make in seducing these Drama Queens is to come
offering stability and security. That will only make them run for the hills.
Most often, Drama Queens (and there are plenty of men in this category)
enjoy playing the victim. They want something to complain about, they
want pain. Pain is a source of pleasure for them. With this type, you have to
be willing and able to give them the mental rough treatment they desire.
That is the only way to seduce them in a deep manner. The moment you
turn too nice, they will find some reason to quarrel or get rid of you.
You will recognize Drama Queens by the number of people who have
hurt them, the tragedies and traumas that have befallen them. At the extreme, they can be hopelessly selfish and anti-seductive, but most of them
are relatively harmless and will make fine victims if you can live with the
sturm und drang. If for some reason you want something long term with
this type, you will constantly have to inject drama into your relationship.
For some this can be an exciting challenge and a source for constantly renewing the relationship. Generally, however, you should see an involvement with a Drama Queen as something fleeting and a way to bring a little
drama into your own life.

The Professor. These types cannot get out of the trap of analyzing and
criticizing everything that crosses their path. Their minds are overdeveloped and overstimulated. Even when they talk about love or sex, it is with
great thought and analysis. Having developed their minds at the expense of
their bodies, many of them feel physically inferior and compensate by lording their mental superiority over others. Their conversation is often wry or
ironic—you never quite know what they are saying, but you sense them
looking down on you. They would like to escape their mental prisons, they
would like pure physicality, without any analysis, but they cannot get there
on their own. Professor types sometimes engage in relationships with other
professor types, or with people they can treat as inferiors. But deep down
they long to be overwhelmed by someone with physical presence—a Rake
or a Siren, for instance.
Professors can make excellent victims, for underneath their intellectual
strength lie gnawing insecurities. Make them feel like Don Juans or Sirens,
to even the slightest degree, and they are your slaves. Many of them have a
masochistic streak that will come out once you stir their dormant senses.
You are offering an escape from the mind, so make it as complete as possible: if you have intellectual tendencies yourself, hide them. They will only

155

156

• The Art of Seduction

stir your target's competitive juices and get their minds turning. Let your
Professors keep their sense of mental superiority; let them judge you. You
will know what they will try to hide: that you are the one in control, for
you are giving them what no one else can give them—physical stimulation.

The Beauty. From early on in life, the Beauty is gazed at by others. Their
desire to look at her is the source of her power, but also the source of much
unhappiness: she constantly worries that her powers are waning, that she
is no longer attracting attention. If she is honest with herself, she also
senses that being worshiped only for one's appearance is monotonous and
unsatisfying—and lonely. Many men are intimidated by beauty and prefer
to worship it from afar; others are drawn in, but not for the purpose of
conversation. The Beauty suffers from isolation.
Because she has so many lacks, the Beauty is relatively easy to seduce,
and if done right, you will have won not only a much prized catch but
someone who will grow dependent on what you provide. Most important
in this seduction is to validate those parts of the Beauty that no one else
appreciates—her intelligence (generally higher than people imagine), her
skills, her character. Of course you must worship her body—you cannot
stir up any insecurities in the one area in which she knows her strength, and
the strength on which she most depends—but you also must worship her
mind and soul. Intellectual stimulation will work well on the Beauty, distracting her from her doubts and insecurities, and making it seem that you
value that side of her personality.
Because the Beauty is always being looked at, she tends to be passive.
Beneath her passivity, though, there often lies frustration: the Beauty would
love to be more active and to actually do some chasing of her own. A little
coquettishness can work well here: at some point in all your worshiping,
you might go a little cold, inviting her to come after you. Train her to be
more active and you will have an excellent victim. The only downside is
that her many insecurities require constant attention and care.

The Aging Baby. Some people refuse to grow up. Perhaps they are afraid
of death or of growing old; perhaps they are passionately attached to the
life they led as children. Disliking responsibility, they struggle to turn
everything into play and recreation. In their twenties they can be charming,
in their thirties interesting, but by the time they reach their forties they are
beginning to wear thin.
Contrary to what you might imagine, one Aging Baby does not want
to be involved with another Aging Baby, even though the combination
might seem to increase the chances for play and frivolity. The Aging Baby
does not want competition, but an adult figure. If you desire to seduce this
type, you must be prepared to be the responsible, staid one. That may be a

The Seducer's Victims—The Eighteen Types •

strange way of seducing, but in this case it works. You should appear to like
the Aging Baby's youthful spirit (it helps if you actually do), can engage
with it, but you remain the indulgent adult. By being responsible you free
the Baby to play. Act the loving adult to the hilt, never judging or criticizing their behavior, and a strong attachment will form. Aging Babies can be
amusing for a while, but, like all children, they are often potently narcissistic. This limits the pleasure you can have with them. You should see them
as short-term amusements or temporary outlets for your frustrated parental
instincts.

The Rescuer. We are often drawn to people who seem vulnerable or
weak—their sadness or depression can actually be quite seductive. There
are people, however, who take this much further, who seem to be attracted
only to people with problems. This may seem noble, but Rescuers usually
have complicated motives: they often have sensitive natures and truly want
to help. At the same time, solving people's problems gives them a kind of
power they relish—it makes them feel superior and in control. It is also the
perfect way to distract them from their own problems. You will recognize
these types by their empathy—they listen well and try to get you to open
up and talk. You will also notice they have histories of relationships with
dependent and troubled people.
Rescuers can make excellent victims, particularly if you enjoy chivalrous or maternal attention. If you are a woman, play the damsel in distress,
giving a man the chance so many men long for—to act the knight. If you
are a man, play the boy who cannot deal with this harsh world; a female
Rescuer will envelop you in maternal attention, gaining for herself the
added satisfaction of feeling more powerful and in control than a man. An
air of sadness will draw either gender in. Exaggerate your weaknesses, but
not through overt words or gestures—let them sense that you have had too
little love, that you have had a string of bad relationships, that you have gotten a raw deal in life. Having lured your Rescuer in with the chance to help
you, you can then stoke the relationship's fires with a steady supply of
needs and vulnerabilities. You can also invite moral rescue: you are bad.
You have done bad things. You need a stern yet loving hand. In this case
the Rescuer gets to feel morally superior, but also the vicarious thrill of involvement with someone naughty.

The Roué. These types have lived the good life and experienced many
pleasures. They probably have, or once had, a good deal of money to finance their hedonistic lives. On the outside they tend to seem cynical and
jaded, but their worldliness often hides a sentimentality that they have
struggled to repress. Roués are consummate seducers, but there is one type
that can easily seduce them—the young and the innocent. As they get

157

158

•

The Art of Seduction

older, they hanker after their lost youth; missing their long-lost innocence,
they begin to covet it in others.
If you should want to seduce them, you will probably have to be somewhat young and to have retained at least the appearance of innocence. It is
easy to play this up—make a show of how little experience you have in the
world, how you still see things as a child. It is also good to seem to resist
their advances: Roués will think it lively and exciting to chase you. You can
even seem to dislike or distrust them—that will really spur them on. By being the one who resists, you control the dynamic. And since you have the
youth that they are missing, you can maintain the upper hand and make
them fall deeply in love. They will often be susceptible to such a fall, because they have tamped down their own romantic tendencies for so long
that when it bursts forth, they lose control. Never give in too early, and
never let your guard down—such types can be dangerous.

The Idol Worshiper. Everyone feels an inner lack, but Idol Worshipers
have a bigger emptiness than most people. They cannot be satisfied with
themselves, so they search the world for something to worship, something
to fill their inner void. This often assumes the form of a great interest in
spiritual matters or in some worthwhile cause; by focusing on something
supposedly elevated, they distract themselves from their own void, from
what they dislike about themselves. Idol Worshipers are easy to spot—they
are the ones pouring their energies into some cause or religion. They often
move around over the years, leaving one cult for another.
The way to seduce these types is to simply become their object of worship, to take the place of the cause or religion to which they are so dedicated. At first you may have to seem to share their spiritual interest, joining
them in their worship, or perhaps exposing them to a new cause; eventually
you will displace it. With this type you have to hide your flaws, or at least
to give them a saintly sheen. Be banal and Idol Worshipers will pass you by.
But mirror the qualities they aspire to have for themselves and they will
slowly transfer their adoration to you. Keep everything on an elevated
plane—let romance and religion flow into one.
Keep two things in mind when seducing this type. First, they tend to
have overactive minds, which can make them quite suspicious. Because
they often lack physical stimulation, and because physical stimulation will
distract them, give them some: a mountain trek, a boat trip, or sex will do
the trick. But this takes a lot of work, for their minds are always ticking.
Second, they often suffer from low self-esteem. Do not try to raise
it; they will see through you, and your efforts at praising them will clash
with their own self-image. They are to worship you; you are not to worship them. Idol Worshipers make perfectly adequate victims in the short
term, but their endless need to search will eventually lead them to look for
something new to adore.

The Seducer's Victims—The Eighteen Types •

The Sensualist. What marks these types is not their love of pleasure
but their overactive senses. Sometimes they show this quality in their
appearance—their interest in fashion, color, style. But sometimes it is
more subtle: because they are so sensitive, they are often quite shy, and
they will shrink from standing out or being flamboyant. You will recognize them by how responsive they are to their environment, how they
cannot stand a room without sunlight, are depressed by certain colors, or
excited by certain smells. They happen to live in a culture that deemphasizes sensual experience (except perhaps for the sense of sight). And so
what the Sensualist lacks is precisely enough sensual experiences to appreciate and relish.
The key to seducing them is to aim for their senses, to take them to
beautiful places, pay attention to detail, envelop them in spectacle, and of
course use plenty of physical lures. Sensualists, like animals, can be baited
with colors and smells. Appeal to as many senses as possible, keeping your
targets distracted and weak. Seductions of Sensualists are often easy and
quick, and you can use the same tactics again and again to keep them interested, although it is wise to vary your sensual appeals somewhat, in kind if
not in quality. That is how Cleopatra worked on Mark Antony, an inveterate Sensualist. These types make superb victims because they are relatively
docile if you give them what they want.

The Lonely Leader. Powerful people are not necessarily different from
everyone else, but they are treated differently, and this has a big effect on
their personalities. Everyone around them tends to be fawning and
courtierlike, to have an angle, to want something from them. This makes
them suspicious and distrustful, and a little hard around the edges, but do
not mistake the appearance for the reality: Lonely Leaders long to be seduced, to have someone break through their isolation and overwhelm
them. The problem is that most people are too intimidated to try, or use
the kind of tactics—flattery, charm—that they see through and despise. To
seduce such types, it is better to act like their equal or even their superior—
the kind of treatment they never get. If you are blunt with them you will
seem genuine, and they will be touched—you care enough to be honest,
even perhaps at some risk. (Being blunt with the powerful can be dangerous.) Lonely Leaders can be made emotional by inflicting some pain, followed by tenderness.
This is one of the hardest types to seduce, not only because they are
suspicious but because their minds are burdened with cares and responsibilities. They have less mental space for a seduction. You will have to be patient and clever, slowly filling their minds with thoughts of you. Succeed,
though, and you can gain great power in turn, for in their loneliness they
will come to depend on you.

The Art of Seduction

The Floating Gender. All of us have a mix of the masculine and the
feminine in our characters, but most of us learn to develop and exhibit the
socially acceptable side while repressing the other. People of the Floating
Gender type feel that the separation of the sexes into such distinct genders
is a burden. They are sometimes thought to be repressed or latent homosexuals, but this is a misunderstanding: they may well be heterosexual but
their masculine and feminine sides are in flux, and because this may discomfit others if they show it, they learn to repress it, perhaps by going to
one extreme. They would actually love to be able to play with their gender,
to give full expression to both sides. Many people fall into this type without
its being obvious: a woman may have a masculine energy, a man a developed aesthetic side. Do not look for obvious signs, because these types
often go underground, keeping it under wraps. This makes them vulnerable to a powerful seduction.
What Floating Gender types are really looking for is another person of
uncertain gender, their counterpart from the opposite sex. Show them that
in your presence and they can relax, express the repressed side of their character. If you have such proclivities, this is the one instance where it would
be best to seduce the same type of the opposite sex. Each person will stir
up repressed desires in the other and will suddenly have license to explore
all kinds of gender combinations, without fear of judgment. If you are not
of the Floating Gender, leave this type alone. You will only inhibit them
and create more discomfort.

M

ost of us understand that certain actions on our part will have a
pleasing and seductive effect on the person we would like to seduce.
The problem is that we are generally too self-absorbed: We think more
about what we want from others than what they could want from us. We
may occasionally do something that is seductive, but often we follow this
up a with a selfish or aggressive action (we are in a hurry to get what we
want); or, unaware of what we are doing, we show a side of ourselves that
is petty and banal, deflating any illusions or fantasies a person might have
about us. Our attempts at seduction usually do not last long enough to create much of an effect.
You will not seduce anyone by simply depending on your engaging
personality, or by occasionally doing something noble or alluring. Seduction is a process that occurs over time—the longer you take and the slower
you go, the deeper you will penetrate into the mind of your victim. It is an
art that requires patience, focus, and strategic thinking. You need to always
be one step ahead of your victim, throwing dust in their eyes, casting a
spell, keeping them off balance.
The twenty-four chapters in this section will arm you with a series of
tactics that will help you get out of yourself and into the mind of your victim, so that you can play it like an instrument. The chapters are placed
in a loose order, going from the initial contact with your victim to the successful conclusion. This order is based on certain timeless laws of human
psychology. Because people's thoughts tend to revolve around their daily
concerns and insecurities, you cannot proceed with a seduction until
you slowly put their anxieties to sleep and fill their distracted minds with
thoughts of you. The opening chapters will help you accomplish this.
There is a natural tendency in relationships for people to become so familiar with one another that boredom and stagnation set in. Mystery is the
lifeblood of seduction and to maintain it you have to constantly surprise
your victims, stir things up, even shock them. A seduction should never settle into a comfortable routine. The middle and later chapters will instruct
you in the art of alternating hope and despair, pleasure and pain, until your
victims weaken and succumb. In each instance, one tactic is setting up the
next one, allowing you to push it further with something bolder and more
violent. A seducer cannot be timid or merciful.
To help you move the seduction along, the chapters are arranged in
163

164

•

The Art of Seduction

four phases, each phase with a particular goal to aim for: getting the victim
to think of you; gaining access to their emotions by creating moments of
pleasure and confusion; going deeper by working on their unconscious,
stirring up repressed desires; and finally, inducing physical surrender. (The
phases are clearly marked and explained with a short introduction.) By following these phases you will work more effectively on your victim's mind
and create the slow and hypnotic pace of a ritual. In fact, the seductive
process may be thought of as a kind of initiation ritual, in which you are
uprooting people from their habits, giving them novel experiences, putting
them through tests, before initiating them into a new life.
It is best to read all of the chapters and gain as much knowledge as possible. When it comes time to apply these tactics, you will want to pick and
choose which ones are appropriate for your particular victim; sometimes
only a few are sufficient, depending on the level of resistance you meet and
the complexity of your victim's problems. These tactics are equally applicable to social and political seductions, minus the sexual component in Phase
Four.
At all cost, resist the temptation to hurry to the climax of your seduction, or to improvise. You are not being seductive but selfish. Everything in
daily life is hurried and improvised, and you need to offer something different. By taking your time and respecting the seductive process you will not
only break down your victim's resistance, you will make them fall in love.

Phase One

Separation—
Stirring Interest and Desire
Your victims live in their own worlds, their minds occupied with
anxieties and daily concerns. Your goal in this initial phase is to
slowly separate them from that closed world and fill their minds
with thoughts of you. Once you have decided whom to seduce
(1: Choose the right victim), your first task is to get your victims' attention, to stir interest in you. For those who might be
more resistant or difficult, you should try a slower and more insidious approach, first winning their friendship (2: Create a
false sense of security—approach indirectly); for those who are
bored and less difficult to reach, a more dramatic approach will
work, either fascinating them with a mysterious presence (3:
Send mixed signals) or seeming to be someone who is coveted
and fought over by others (4: Appear to be an object of desire).

Once the victim is properly intrigued, you need to transform
their interest into something stronger—desire. Desire is generally
preceded by feelings of emptiness, of something missing inside
that needs fulfillment. You must deliberately instill such feelings,
make your victims aware of the adventure and romance that are
lacking in their lives (5: Create a need—stir anxiety and discontent). If they see you as the one to fill their emptiness, interest will blossom into desire. The desire should be stoked by
subtly planting ideas in their minds, hints of the seductive pleasures that await them (6: Master the art of insinuation). Mirroring your victims' values, indulging them in their wants and
moods will charm and delight them (7: Enter their spirit).
Without realizing how it has happened, more and more of their
thoughts now revolve around you. The time has come for something stronger. Lure them with an irresistible pleasure or adventure (8: Create temptation) and they will follow your lead.

Choose the Right Victim

Everything depends on the target of your seduction. Study your prey thoroughly, and choose
only those who will prove susceptible to your
charms. The right victims are those for whom you can fill
a void, who see in you something exotic. They are often
isolated or at least somewhat unhappy (perhaps because of recent adverse circumstances), or can easily be made so—for the
completely contented person is almost impossible to seduce.
The perfect victim has some natural quality that attracts
you. The strong emotions this quality inspires will
help make your seductive maneuvers seem more
natural and dynamic. The perfect victim
allows for the perfect chase.

Preparing for the Hunt
he young Vicomte de Valmont was a notorious libertine in the Paris of
the 1770s, the ruin of many a young girl and the ingenious seducer of
the wives of illustrious aristocrats. But after a while the repetitiveness of it
all began to bore him; his successes came too easily So one year, during the
sweltering, slow month of August, he decided to take a break from Paris
and visit his aunt at her château in the provinces. Life there was not what
he was used to—there were country walks, chats with the local vicar, card
games. His city friends, particularly his fellow libertine and confidante the
Marquise de Merteuil, expected him to hurry back.
There were other guests at the château, however, including the Présidente de Tourvel, a twenty-two-year-old woman whose husband was temporarily absent, having work to do elsewhere. The Présidente had been
languishing at the château, waiting for him to join her. Valmont had met
her before; she was certainly beautiful, but had a reputation as a prude who
was extremely devoted to her husband. She was not a court lady; her taste
in clothing was atrocious (she always covered her neck with ghastly frills)
and her conversation lacked wit. For some reason, however, far from Paris,
Valmont began to see these traits in a new light. He followed her to the
chapel where she went every morning to pray. He caught glimpses of her at
dinner, or playing cards. Unlike the ladies of Paris, she seemed unaware of
her charms; this excited him. Because of the heat, she wore a simple linen
dress, which revealed her figure. A piece of muslin covered her breasts, letting him more than imagine them. Her hair, unfashionable in its slight disorder, conjured the bedroom. And her face—he had never noticed how
expressive it was. Her features lit up when she gave alms to a beggar; she
blushed at the slightest praise. She was so natural and unself-conscious. And
when she talked of her husband, or religious matters, he could sense the
depth of her feelings. If such a passionate nature were ever detoured into a
love affair. . . .
Valmont extended his stay at the château, much to the delight of his
aunt, who could not have guessed at the reason. And he wrote to the Marquise de Merteuil, explaining his new ambition: to seduce Madame de
Tourvel. The Marquise was incredulous. He wanted to seduce this prude?
If he succeeded, how little pleasure she would give him, and if he failed,
what a disgrace—the great libertine unable to seduce a wife whose husband
was far away! She wrote a sarcastic letter, which only inflamed Valmont fur-

ther. The conquest of this notoriously virtuous woman would prove his
greatest seduction. His reputation would only be enhanced.
There was an obstacle, though, that seemed to make success almost impossible: everyone knew Valmont's reputation, including the Présidente.
She knew how dangerous it was to ever be alone with him, how people
would talk about the least association with him. Valmont did everything
to belie his reputation, even going so far as to attend church services and
seem repentant of his ways. The Présidente noticed, but still kept her distance. The challenge she presented to Valmont was irresistible, but could he
meet it?
Valmont decided to test the waters. One day he arranged a little walk
with the Présidente and his aunt. He chose a delightful path that they had
never taken before, but at a certain point they reached a little ditch, unsuitable for a lady to cross on her own. And yet, Valmont said, the rest of the
walk was too nice for them to turn back, and he gallantly picked up his
aunt in his arms and carried her across the ditch, making the Présidente
laugh uproariously. But then it was her turn, and Valmont purposefully
picked her up a little awkwardly, so that she caught at his arms, and while
he was holding her against him he could feel her heart beating faster, and
saw her blush. His aunt saw this too, and cried out, "The child is afraid!"
But Valmont sensed otherwise. Now he knew that the challenge could be
met, that the Présidente could be won. The seduction could proceed.

Keys to Seduction

T

hroughout life we find ourselves having to persuade people—to seduce them. Some will be relatively open to our influence, if only in
subtle ways, while others seem impervious to our charms. Perhaps we find
this a mystery beyond our control, but that is an ineffective way of dealing
with life. Seducers, whether sexual or social, prefer to pick the odds. As
often as possible they go toward people who betray some vulnerability to
them, and avoid the ones who cannot be moved. To leave people who are
inaccessible to you alone is a wise path; you cannot seduce everyone. On the
other hand, you must actively hunt out the prey that responds the right way.
This will make your seductions that much more pleasurable and satisfying.
How do you recognize your victims? By the way they respond to you.
You should not pay so much attention to their conscious responses—a person who is obviously trying to please or charm you is probably playing to
your vanity, and wants something from you. Instead, pay greater attention
to those responses outside conscious control—a blush, an involuntary mir-

roring of some gesture of yours, an unusual shyness, even perhaps a flash of
anger or resentment. All of these show that you are having an effect on a
person who is open to your influence.
Like Valmont, you can also recognize the right targets by the effect they
are having on you. Perhaps they make you uneasy—perhaps they correspond to a deep-rooted childhood ideal, or represent some kind of personal
taboo that excites you, or suggest the person you imagine you would be if
you were the opposite sex. When a person has such a deep effect on you, it

Choose the Right Victim

Be careful with appearances. The person who seems volcanically passionate is often hiding insecurity and self-involvement. This was what most
men failed to perceive in the nineteenth-century courtesan Lola Montez.
She seemed so dramatic, so exciting. In fact, she was a troubled, selfobsessed woman, but by the time men discovered this it was too late—they
had become involved with her and could not extricate themselves without
months of drama and torture. People who are outwardly distant or shy are
often better targets than extroverts. They are dying to be drawn out, and
still waters run deep.
People with a lot of time on their hands are extremely susceptible to seduction. They have mental space for you to fill. Tullia d'Aragona, the infamous sixteenth-century Italian courtesan, preferred young men as her
victims; besides the physical reason for such a preference, they were more
idle than working men with careers, and therefore more defenseless against
an ingenious seductress. On the other hand, you should generally avoid
people who are preoccupied with business or work—seduction demands
attention, and busy people have too little space in their minds for you to
occupy.
According to Freud, seduction begins early in life, in our relationship
with our parents. They seduce us physically, both with bodily contact and
by satisfying desires such as hunger, and we in turn try to seduce them into
paying us attention. We are creatures by nature vulnerable to seduction
throughout our lives. We all want to be seduced; we yearn to be drawn out
of ourselves, out of our routines and into the drama of eros. And what
draws us more than anything is the feeling that someone has something we
don't, a quality we desire. Your perfect victims are often people who think
you have something they don't, and who will be enchanted to have it provided for them. Such victims may have a temperament quite the opposite
of yours, and this difference will create an exciting tension.
When Jiang Qing, later known as Madame Mao, first met Mao Tsetung in 1937 in his mountain retreat in western China, she could sense
how desperate he was for a bit of color and spice in his life: all the camp's
women dressed like the men, and abjured any feminine finery. Jiang had
been an actress in Shanghai, and was anything but austere. She supplied
what he lacked, and she also gave him the added thrill of being able to educate her in communism, appealing to his Pygmalion complex—the desire
to dominate, control, and remake a person. In fact it was Jiang Qing who
controlled her future husband.
The greatest lack of all is excitement and adventure, which is precisely
what seduction offers. In 1964, the Chinese actor Shi Pei Pu, a man who
had gained fame as a female impersonator, met Bernard Bouriscout, a young
diplomat assigned to the French embassy in China. Bouriscout had come
to China looking for adventure, and was disappointed to have little contact
with Chinese people. Pretending to be a woman who, when still a child,
had been forced to live as a boy—supposedly the family already had too

discontent to manipulate him. Inventing a story of the deceptions he had
had to go through, he slowly drew Bouriscout into an affair that would last
many years. (Bouriscout had had previous homosexual encounters, but considered himself heterosexual.) Eventually the diplomat was led into spying
for the Chinese. All the while, he believed Shi Pei Pu was a woman—his
yearning for adventure had made him that vulnerable. Repressed types are
perfect victims for a deep seduction.
People who repress the appetite for pleasure make ripe victims, particularly later in their lives. The eighth-century Chinese Emperor Ming Huang
spent much of his reign trying to rid his court of its costly addiction to luxuries, and was himself a model of austerity and virtue. But the moment he
saw the concubine Yang Kuei-fei bathing in a palace lake, everything
changed. The most charming woman in the realm, she was the mistress of
his son. Exerting his power, the emperor won her away—only to become
her abject slave.
The choice of the right victim is equally important in politics. Mass seducers such as Napoleon or John F. Kennedy offer their public just what it
lacks. When Napoleon came to power, the French people's sense of pride
was beaten down by the bloody aftermath of the French Revolution. He
offered them glory and conquest. Kennedy recognized that Americans
were bored with the stultifying comfort of the Eisenhower years; he gave
them adventure and risk. More important, he tailored his appeal to the
group most vulnerable to it: the younger generation. Successful politicians
know that not everyone will be susceptible to their charm, but if they can
find a group of believers with a need to be filled, they have supporters who
will stand by them no matter what.

If you are too
direct early on, you risk stirring up a resistance that will never be
lowered. At first there must be nothing of the
seducer in your manner. The seduction should begin
at an angle, indirectly, so that the target only gradually
becomes aware of you. Haunt the periphery of your target's
life—approach through a third party, or seem to cultivate a
relatively neutral relationship, moving gradually from friend to
lover. Arrange an occasional "chance" encounter, as if you and your
target were destined to become acquainted—nothing is more seductive
than a sense of destiny. Lull the target into feeling secure, then strike.

n warfare, you need space to align your troops, room to maneuver. The
more space you have, the more intricate your strategy can be. But sometimes it is better to overwhelm the enemy, giving them no time to think or
react. Although Casanova adapted his strategies to the woman in question,
he would often try to make an immediate impression, stirring her desire at
the first encounter. Perhaps he would perform some gallantry, rescuing a
woman in danger; perhaps he would dress so that his target would notice
him in a crowd. In either case, once he had the woman's attention he
would move with lightning speed. A Siren like Cleopatra tries to have an
immediate physical effect on men, giving her victims no time or space to
retreat. She uses the element of surprise. The first period of your contact
with someone can involve a level of desire that will never be repeated;
boldness will carry the day.
But these are short seductions. The Sirens and the Casanovas only get
pleasure from the number of their victims, moving quickly from conquest
to conquest, and this can be tiring. Casanova burned himself out; Sirens,
insatiable, are never satisfied. The indirect, carefully constructed seduction
may reduce the number of your conquests, but more than compensate by
their quality.

look in her eye as she glanced at him. The angelic voice, the glances, the
energy animating her face, sent his mind reeling. He was confused. When
the same thing happened the next night, the prince decided to extend his
stay at the château.
In the days that followed, the prince and Madame Récamier took walks
together, rowed out on the lake, and attended dances, where he finally held
her in his arms. They would talk late into the night. But nothing grew clear
to him: she would seem so spiritual, so noble, and then there would be
a touch of the hand, a sudden flirtatious remark. After two weeks at the
château, the most eligible bachelor in Europe forgot all his libertine habits
and proposed marriage to Madame Récamier. He would convert to Catholicism, her religion, and she would divorce her much older husband. (She
had told him her marriage had never been consummated and so the

The seductive process involves filling someone's mind with your image.
Your innocence, or your beauty, or your flirtatiousness can attract their attention but not their obsession; they will soon move on to the next striking
image. To deepen their interest, you must hint at a complexity that cannot
be grasped in a week or two. You are an elusive mystery, an irresistible lure,
promising great pleasure if only it can be possessed. Once they begin to
fantasize about you, they are on the brink of the slippery slope of seduction, and will not be able to stop themselves from sliding down.

plauding far too loudly at his entrance. Wilde was not the least bit flustered.
The audience laughed hysterically at his improvised comments, and when
the boys heckled him he kept his dignity, betraying no anger at all. Once
again, the contrast between his manner and his physical appearance made
him seem rather extraordinary. Many were deeply impressed, and Wilde
was well on his way to becoming a sensation.
The short lecture tour turned into a cross-country affair. In San Francisco, this visiting lecturer on art and aesthetics proved able to drink everyone under the table and play poker, which made him the hit of the season.
On his way back from the West Coast, Wilde was to make stops in Colorado, and was warned that if the pretty-boy poet dared to show up in the
mining town of Leadville, he would be hung from the highest tree. It was
an invitation Wilde could not refuse. Arriving in Leadville, he ignored the
hecklers and nasty looks; he toured the mines, drank and played cards, then
lectured on Botticelli and Cellini in the saloons. Like everyone else, the
miners fell under his spell, even naming a mine after him. One cowboy was
heard to say, "That fellow is some art guy, but he can drink any of us under
the table and afterwards carry us home two at a time."

Interpretation. In a fable he improvised at dinner once, Oscar Wilde talked
about some steel filings that had a sudden desire to visit a nearby magnet.
As they talked to each other about this, they found themselves moving
closer to the magnet without realizing how or why. Finally they were swept
in one mass to the magnet's side. "Then the magnet smiled—for the steel
filings had no doubt at all but that they were paying that visit of their

Keys to Seduction
othing can proceed in seduction unless you can attract and hold your
victim's attention, your physical presence becoming a haunting mental presence. It is actually quite easy to create that first stir—an alluring style
of dress, a suggestive glance, something extreme about you. But what happens next? Our minds are barraged with images—not just from media but
from the disorder of daily life. And many of these images are quite striking.
You become just one more thing screaming for attention; your attractiveness will pass unless you spark the more enduring kind of spell that makes
people think of you in your absence. That means engaging their imaginations, making them think there is more to you than what they see. Once
they start embellishing your image with their fantasies, they are hooked.
This must, however, be done early on, before your targets know too
much and their impressions of you are set. It should occur the moment
they lay eyes on you. By sending mixed signals in that first encounter, you
create a little surprise, a little tension: you seem to be one thing (innocent,
brash, intellectual, witty), but you also throw them a glimpse of something
else (devilish, shy, spontaneous, sad). Keep things subtle: if the second
quality is too strong, you will seem schizophrenic. But make them wonder
why you might be shy or sad underneath your brash intellectual wit, and
you will have their attention. Give them an ambiguity that lets them see
what they want to see, capture their imagination with little voyeuristic
glimpses into your dark soul.
The Greek philosopher Socrates was one of history's greatest seducers;
the young men who followed him as students were not just fascinated by
his ideas, they fell in love with him. One such youth was Alcibiades, the
notorious playboy who became a powerful political figure near the end of
the fifth century B.C. In Plato's Symposium, Alcibiades describes Socrates's
seductive powers by comparing him to the little figures of Silenus that were
made back then. In Greek myth, Silenus was quite ugly, but also a wise
prophet. Accordingly the statues of Silenus were hollow, and when you
took them apart, you would find little figures of gods inside them—the inner truth and beauty under the unappealing exterior. And so, for Alcibiades, it was the same with Socrates, who was so ugly as to be repellent but
whose face radiated inner beauty and contentment. The effect was confus-

entrance, is critical. To show too much desire for attention is to signal insecurity, and will often drive people away; play it too cold and disinterested,
on the other hand, and no one will bother coming near. The trick is
to combine the two attitudes at the same moment. It is the essence of
coquetry.
Perhaps you have a reputation for a particular quality, which immediately comes to mind when people see you. You will better hold their
attention by suggesting that behind this reputation some other quality lies
lurking. No one had a darker, more sinful reputation than Lord Byron.
What drove women wild was that behind his somewhat cold and disdainful
exterior, they could sense that he was actually quite romantic, even spiritual. Byron played this up with his melancholic airs and occasional kind
deed. Transfixed and confused, many women thought that they could be
the one to lead him back to goodness, to make him a faithful lover. Once a
woman entertained such a thought, she was completely under his spell. It is
not difficult to create such a seductive effect. Should you be known as eminently rational, say, hint at something irrational. Johannes, the narrator in
Kierkegaard's The Seducer's Diary, first treats the young Cordelia with
businesslike politeness, as his reputation would lead her to expect. Yet she
very soon overhears him making remarks that hint at a wild, poetic streak
in his character; and she is excited and intrigued.
These principles have applications far beyond sexual seduction. To hold
the attention of a broad public, to seduce them into thinking about you,
you need to mix your signals. Display too much of one quality—even if it
is a noble one, like knowledge or efficiency—and people will feel that you
lack humanity. We are all complex and ambiguous, full of contradictory
impulses; if you show only one side, even if it is your good side, you will
wear on people's nerves. They will suspect you are a hypocrite. Mahatma
Gandhi, a saintly figure, openly confessed to feelings of anger and vengefulness. John F. Kennedy, the most seductive American public figure of
modern times, was a walking paradox: an East Coast aristocrat with a love
of the common man, an obviously masculine man—a war hero—with a
vulnerability you could sense underneath, an intellectual who loved popular culture. People were drawn to Kennedy like the steel filings in Wilde's
fable. A bright surface may have a decorative charm, but what draws your
eye into a painting is a depth of field, an inexpressible ambiguity, a surreal
complexity.

he complexity you signal to other people will only affect them properly if they have the capacity to enjoy a mystery. Some people like
things simple, and lack the patience to pursue a person who confuses them.
They prefer to be dazzled and overwhelmed. The great Belle Epoque courtesan known as La Belle Otero would work a complex magic on artists and
political figures who fell for her, but in dealing with the more uncomplicated, sensual male she would astound them with spectacle and beauty.
When meeting a woman for the first time, Casanova might dress in the
most fantastic outfit, with jewels and brilliant colors to dazzle the eye; he
would use the target's reaction to gauge whether or not she would demand
a more complicated seduction. Some of his victims, particularly young
girls, needed no more than the glittering and spellbinding appearance,
which was really what they wanted, and the seduction would stay on that
level.
Everything depends on your target: do not bother creating depth for
people who are insensitive to it, or who may even be put off or disturbed
by it. You can recognize such types by their preference for the simpler pleasures in life, their lack of patience for a more nuanced story. With them,
keep it simple.

Appear to Be an Object of Desire

Few are drawn to the person whom others avoid or neglect; people gather around those who have already attracted interest. We want what other people want. To draw
your victims closer and make them hungry to possess you, you
must create an aura of desirability—of being wanted and
courted by many. It will become a point of vanity for them to
be the preferred object of your attention, to win you away from
a crowd of admirers. Manufacture the illusion of popularity
by surrounding yourself with members of the opposite

O

ne evening in 1882, the thirty-two-year-old Prussian philosopher
Paul Rée, living in Rome at the time, visited the house of an older
woman who ran a salon for writers and artists. Rée noticed a newcomer
there, a twenty-one-year-old Russian girl named Lou von Salomé, who
had come to Rome on holiday with her mother. Rée introduced himself
and they began a conversation that lasted well into the night. Her ideas Let me tell you about a

you desirable. It is reassuring. There is nothing like a restaurant full of
empty tables to persuade you not to go in.
A variation on the triangle strategy is the use of contrasts: careful exploitation of people who are dull or unattractive may enhance your desirability by comparison. At a social affair, for instance, make sure that your
target has to chat with the most boring person available. Come to the rescue and your target will be delighted to see you. In The Seducer's Diary, by
Søren Kierkegaard, Johannes has designs on the innocent young Cordelia.
Knowing that his friend Edward is hopelessly shy and dull, he encourages
this man to court her; a few weeks of Edward's attentions will make her
eyes wander in search of someone else, anyone else, and Johannes will make
sure that they settle on him. Johannes chose to strategize and maneuver, but
almost any social environment will contain contrasts you can make use of
almost naturally. The seventeenth-century English actress Nell Gwyn became the main mistress of King Charles II because her humor and unaffectedness made her that much more desirable among the many stiff and
pretentious ladies of Charles's court. When the Shanghai actress Jiang Qing
met Mao Zedong, in 1937, she did not have to do much to seduce him;
the other women in his mountain camp in Yenan dressed like men, and
were decidedly unfeminine. The sight alone of Jiang was enough to seduce
Mao, who soon left his wife for her. To make use of contrasts, either develop and display those attractive attributes (humor, vivacity, and so on) that
are the scarcest in your own social group, or choose a group in which your
natural qualities are rare, and will shine.
The use of contrasts has vast political ramifications, for a political figure
must also seduce and seem desirable. Learn to play up the qualities that your
rivals lack. Peter II, czar in eighteenth-century Russia, was arrogant and irresponsible, so his wife, Catherine the Great, did all she could to seem
modest and dependable. When Vladimir Lenin returned to Russia in 1917
after Czar Nicholas II had been deposed, he made a show of decisiveness

and discipline—precisely what no other leader had at the time. In the
American presidential race of 1980, the irresoluteness of Jimmy Carter
made the single-mindedness of Ronald Reagan look desirable. Contrasts
are eminently seductive because they do not depend on your own words or
self-advertisements. The public reads them unconsciously, and sees what it
wants to see.
Finally, appearing to be desired by others will raise your value, but often
how you carry yourself can influence this as well. Do not let your targets
see you so often; keep your distance, seem unattainable, out of their reach.
An object that is rare and hard to obtain is generally more prized.

Symbol: The Trophy.
What makes you want to win the trophy, and to see it as
something worth having, is the sight of the other competitors. Some,
out of a spirit of kindness, may want to reward everyone for trying, but
the Trophy then loses its value. It must represent not only
your victory but everyone else's defeat.

novel was about to be published), he needed to make more money. Caught
off guard by this sudden announcement, and overwhelmed with happiness,
Jessie agreed to everything, and they became lovers.
Soon, however, the familiar pattern repeated: criticisms, breakups, announcements that he was engaged to another girl. This only deepened his
hold on her. It was not until 1912 that she finally decided never to see him
again, disturbed by his portrayal of her in the autobiographical novel Sons
and Lovers. But Lawrence remained a lifelong obsession for her.
In 1913, a young English woman named Ivy Low, who had read
Lawrence's novels, began to correspond with him, her letters gushing with
admiration. By now Lawrence was married, to a German woman, the
Baroness Frieda von Richthofen. To Low's surprise, though, he invited her
to visit him and his wife in Italy. She knew he was probably something of a
Don Juan, but was eager to meet him, and accepted his invitation.
Lawrence was not what she had expected: his voice was high-pitched, his
eyes were piercing, and there was something vaguely feminine about him.
Soon they were taking walks together, with Lawrence confiding in Low.
She felt that they were becoming friends, which delighted her. Then suddenly, just before she was to leave, he launched into a series of criticisms of
her—she was so unspontaneous, so predictable, less human being than robot. Devastated by this unexpected attack, she nevertheless had to agree—
what he had said was true. What could he have seen in her in the first
place? Who was she anyway? Low left Italy feeling empty—but then
Lawrence continued to write to her, as if nothing had happened. She soon
realized that she had fallen hopelessly in love with him, despite everything
he had said to her. Or was it not despite what he had said, but because of it?
In 1914, the writer John Middleton-Murry received a letter from
Lawrence, a good friend of his. In the letter, out of nowhere, Lawrence
criticized Middleton-Murry for being passionless and not gallant enough
with his wife, the novelist Katherine Mansfield. Middleton-Murry later
wrote, "I had never felt for a man before what his letter made me feel for
him. It was a new thing, a unique thing, in my experience; and it was to remain unique." He felt that beneath Lawrence's criticisms lay some weird
kind of affection. Whenever he saw Lawrence from then on, he felt a
strange physical attraction that he could not explain.

Interpretation. The number of women, and of men, who fell under
Lawrence's spell is astonishing given how unpleasant he could be. In almost
every case the relationship began in friendship—with frank talks, exchanges
of confidences, a spiritual bond. Then, invariably, he would suddenly turn
against them, voicing harsh personal criticisms. He would know them well
by that time, and the criticisms were often quite accurate, and hit a nerve.
This would inevitably trigger confusion in his victims, and a sense of anxiety, a feeling that something was wrong with them. Jolted out of their usual
sense of normality, they would feel divided inside. With half of their minds

Keys to Seduction
veryone wears a mask in society; we pretend to be more sure of ourselves than we are. We do not want other people to glimpse that
doubting self within us. In truth, our egos and personalities are much more
fragile than they appear to be; they cover up feelings of confusion and
emptiness. As a seducer, you must never mistake a person's appearance for
the reality. People are always susceptible to being seduced, because in fact
everyone lacks a sense of completeness, feels something missing deep inside. Bring their doubts and anxieties to the surface and they can be led and
lured to follow you.
No one can see you as someone to follow or fall in love with unless
they first reflect on themselves somehow, and on what they are missing. Before the seduction proceeds, you must place a mirror in front of them in

which they glimpse that inner emptiness. Made aware of a lack, they now
can focus on you as the person who can fill that empty space. Remember:
most of us are lazy. To relieve our feelings of boredom or inadequacy on
our own takes too much effort; letting someone else do the job is both
easier and more exciting. The desire to have someone fill up our emptiness
is the weakness on which all seducers prey. Make people anxious about the
future, make them depressed, make them question their identity, make
them sense the boredom that gnaws at their life. The ground is prepared.
The seeds of seduction can be sown.
In Plato's dialogue Symposium—the West's oldest treatise on love, and a
text that has had a determining influence on our ideas of desire—the courtesan Diotima explains to Socrates the parentage of Eros, the god of love.
Eros's father was Contrivance, or Cunning, and his mother was Poverty, or
Need. Eros takes after his parents: he is constantly in need, which he is constantly contriving to fill. As the god of love, he knows that love cannot be
induced in another person unless they too feel need. And that is what his
arrows do: piercing people's flesh, they make them feel a lack, an ache, a
hunger. This is the essence of your task as a seducer. Like Eros, you must

change, difference, a breakup of routines. Make your victims feel that by
comparison their lives are boring and their friends less interesting than they
had thought. Lawrence made his targets feel personally inadequate; if you
find it hard to be so brutal, concentrate on their friends, their circumstances, the externals of their lives. There are many legends of Don Juan,
but they often describe him seducing a village girl by making her feel that
her life is horribly provincial. He, meanwhile, wears glittering clothes and
has a noble bearing. Strange and exotic, he is always from somewhere else.
First she feels the boredom of her life, then she sees him as her salvation.
Remember: people prefer to feel that if their life is uninteresting, it not because of themselves but because of their circumstances, the dull people
they know, the town into which they were born. Once you make them feel
the lure of the exotic, seduction is easy.
Another devilishly seductive area to aim at is the victim's past. To grow
old is to renounce or compromise youthful ideals, to become less spontaneous, less alive in a way. This knowledge lies dormant in all of us. As a seducer you must bring it to the surface, make it clear how far people have
strayed from their past goals and ideals. You, in turn, present yourself as
representing that ideal, as offering a chance to recapture lost youth through
adventure—through seduction. In her later years, Queen Elizabeth I of England was known as a rather stern and demanding ruler. She made it a point
not to let her courtiers see anything soft or weak in her. But then Robert
Devereux, the second Earl of Essex, came to court. Much younger than
the queen, the dashing Essex would often chastize her for her sourness.
The queen would forgive him—he was so exuberant and spontaneous, he
could not control himself. But his comments got under her skin; in the presence of Essex she came to remember all the youthful ideals—spiritedness,
feminine charm—that had since vanished from her life. She also felt a little
of that girlish spirit return when she was around him. He quickly became
her favorite, and soon she was in love with him. Old age is constantly seduced by youth, but first the young people must make it clear what the
older ones are missing, how they have lost their ideals. Only then will they
feel that the presence of the young will let them recapture that spark, the
rebellious spirit that age and society have conspired to repress.
This concept has infinite applications. Corporations and politicians
know that they cannot seduce their public into buying what they want
them to buy, or doing what they want them to do, unless they first awaken
a sense of need and discontent. Make the masses uncertain about their
identity and you can help define it for them. It is as true of groups or nations as it is of individuals: they cannot be seduced without being made to
feel some lack. Part of John F. Kennedy's election strategy in 1960 was to
make Americans unhappy about the 1950s, and how far the country had
strayed from its ideals. In talking about the 1950s, he did not mention the
nation's economic stability or its emergence as a superpower. Instead, he
implied that the period was marked by conformity, a lack of risk and adventure, a loss of our frontier values. To vote for Kennedy was to embark

on a collective adventure, to go back to ideals we had given up. But before
anyone joined his crusade they had to be made aware of how much they
had lost, what was missing. A group, like an individual, can get mired in
routine, losing track of its original goals. Too much prosperity saps it of
strength. You can seduce an entire nation by aiming at its collective insecurity, that latent sense that not everything is what it seems. Stirring dissatisfaction with the present and reminding people about the glorious past can
unsettle their sense of identity. Then you can be the one to redefine it—a
grand seduction.

Reversal
f you go too far in lowering the targets' self-esteem they may feel too insecure to enter into your seduction. Do not be heavy-handed; like
Lawrence, always follow up the wounding attack with a soothing gesture.
Otherwise you will simply alienate them.
Charm is often a subtler and more effective route to seduction. The
Victorian Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli always made people feel better
about themselves. He deferred to them, made them the center of attention,
made them feel witty and vibrant. He was a boon to their vanity, and they
grew addicted to him. This is a kind of diffused seduction, lacking in tension and in the deep emotions that the sexual variety stirs; it bypasses people's hunger, their need for some kind of fulfillment. But if you are subtle
and clever, it can be a way of lowering their defenses, creating an unthreatening friendship. Once they are under your spell in this way, you can then
open the wound. Indeed, after Disraeli had charmed Queen Victoria and
established a friendship with her, he made her feel vaguely inadequate in
the establishment of an empire and the realization of her ideals. Everything
depends on the target. People who are riddled with insecurities may require the gentler variety. Once they feel comfortable with you, aim your
arrows.

The Art of Seduction

A few short years ago, in
our native city, where fraud
and cunning prosper more
than love or loyalty, there
was a noblewoman of
striking beauty and
impeccable breeding, who
was endowed by Nature
with as lofty a
temperament and shrewd
an intellect as could be
found in any other woman
of her time. . . . • This
lady, being of gentle birth
and finding herself married
off to a master woollendraper because he happened
to be very rich, was unable
to stifle her heartfelt
contempt, for she was
firmly of the opinion that
no man of low condition,
however wealthy, was
deserving of a noble wife.
And on discovering that all
he was capable of despite
his massive wealth, was
distinguishing wool from
cotton, supervising the
setting up of a loom, or
debating the virtues of a
particular yarn with a
spinner-woman, she
resolved that as far as it lay
within her power she
would have nothing
whatsoever to do with his
beastly caresses. Moreover
she was determined to seek
her pleasure elsewhere, in
the company of one who
seemed more worthy of her
affection, and so it was that
she fell deeply in love with
an extremely eligible man
in his middle thirties. And
whenever a day passed
without her having set eyes
upon him, she was restless
for the whole of the
following night. •
However, the gentleman
suspected nothing of all
this, and took no notice of
her; and for her part, being

his lover: "Is she making you quite happy? Oh, I fear the contrary, and this
distresses me. . . . Are you not often the victim of her strange whims?" To
the young man's surprise, Madame began to talk of the countess in a way
that made it seem that she had been unfaithful to him (which was something he had suspected). Madame sighed—she regretted saying such things
about her friend, and asked him to forgive her; then, as if a new thought
had occurred to her, she mentioned a nearby pavilion, a delightful place,
full of pleasant memories. But the shame of it was, it was locked and she
had no key. And yet they found their way to the pavilion, and lo and behold, the door had been left open. It was dark inside, but the young man
could sense that it was a place for trysts. They entered and sank onto a sofa,
and before he knew what had come over him, he took her in his arms.
Madame seemed to push him away, but then gave in. Finally she came to
her senses: they must return to the house. Had he gone too far? He must
try to control himself.
As they strolled back to the house, Madame remarked, "What a delicious night we've just spent." Was she referring to what had happened in
the pavilion? "There is an even more charming room in the château," she
went on, "but I can't show you anything," implying he had been too forward. She had mentioned this room ("Monsieur's apartment") several times
before; he could not imagine what could be so interesting about it, but by
now he was dying to see it and insisted she show it to him. "If you promise
to be good," she replied, her eyes widening. Through the darkness of the
house she led him into the room, which, to his delight, was a kind of temple of pleasure: there were mirrors on the walls, trompe l'oeil paintings
evoking a forest scene, even a dark grotto, and a garlanded statue of Eros.
Overwhelmed by the mood of the place, the young man quickly resumed
what he had started in the pavilion, and would have lost all track of time
if a servant had not rushed in and warned them that it was getting light
outside—Monsieur would soon be up.
They quickly separated. Later that day, as the young man prepared to
leave, his hostess said, "Goodbye, Monsieur; I owe you so many pleasures;
but I have paid you with a beautiful dream. Now your love summons you
to return. . . . Don't give the Countess cause to quarrel with me." Reflecting on his experience on the way back, he could not figure out what it
meant. He had the vague sensation of having been used, but the pleasures
he remembered outweighed his doubts.

The Art of Seduction

Since people are always reading your looks, use them to transmit the insinuating signals you choose.
Finally, the reason insinuation works so well is not just that it bypasses
people's natural resistance. It is also the language of pleasure. There is too
little mystery in the world; too many people say exactly what they feel or
want. We yearn for something enigmatic, for something to feed our fantasies. Because of the lack of suggestion and ambiguity in daily life, the
person who uses them suddenly seems to have something alluring and full
of promise. It is a kind of titillating game—what is this person up to? What
does he or she mean? Hints, suggestions, and insinuations create a seductive
atmosphere, signaling that their victim is no longer involved in the routines
of daily life but has entered another realm.

Symbol: The Seed.
The soil is carefully prepared. The seeds are planted
months in advance. Once they are in the ground, no one

Reversal

T

he danger in insinuation is that when you leave things ambiguous your
target may misread them. There are moments, particularly later on in a
seduction, when it is best to communicate your idea directly, particularly
once you know the target will welcome it, Casanova often played things
that way. When he could sense that a woman desired him, and needed little
preparation, he would use a direct, sincere, gushing comment to go straight
to her head like a drug and make her fall under his spell. When the rake
and writer Gabriele D'Annunzio met a woman he desired, he rarely delayed. Flattery flowed from his mouth and pen. He would charm with his
"sincerity" (sincerity can be feigned, and is just one stratagem among others). This only works, however, when you sense that the target is easily
yours. If not, the defenses and suspicions you raise by direct attack will
make your seduction impossible. When in doubt, indirection is the better
route.

Enter Their Spirit

Most
people are locked in their
own worlds, making them stubborn
and hard to persuade.

The way to lure

them out of their shell and set up your seduction is
to enter their spirit. Play by their rules, enjoy what they
enjoy, adapt yourself to their moods. In doing so you will
stroke their deep-rooted narcissism and lower their defenses.
Hypnotized by the mirror image you present, they will open up,
becoming vulnerable to your subtle influence. Soon you can
shift the dynamic: once you have entered their spirit you
can make them enter yours, at a point when it is
too late to turn back. Indulge your targets'
every mood and whim, giving them
nothing to react against or
resist.

The Indulgent Strategy
n October of 1961, the American journalist Cindy Adams was granted
an exclusive interview with President Sukarno of Indonesia. It was a remarkable coup, for Adams was a little-known journalist at the time, while
Sukarno was a world figure in the midst of a crisis. A leader of the fight for
Indonesia's independence, he had been the country's president since 1949,

reckoned to be one of the
ways of attracting. The
Sanskrit texts, for
example, give an important
part to the trick of the
woman copying the dress,
expressions, and speech of
her beloved. This kind of
mimetic drama is urged on
the woman who, "being
unable to unite with her
beloved, imitates him to
distract his thoughts." •
The child too, using the
devices of imitating
attitudes, dress, and so on,
seeks to fascinate, until a
magical intention, the
father or mother and thus
to "distract its thoughts."
Identification means that
one is abandoning and not
abandoning amorous
desires. It is a lure which
the child uses to capture his
parents and which, it must
be admitted, they fall for.

swered, apparently somewhat abashed. One, however, was not enough, she
went on; she required several planes, and a helicopter, and her own personal pilot, a good one. He agreed to everything. The leader of Indonesia
seemed to be not just intimidated by Adams but totally under her spell. He
praised her intelligence and wit. At one point he confided, "Do you know
why I'm doing this biography? . . . Only because of you, that's why." He
paid attention to her clothes, complimenting her outfits, noticing any
change in them. He was more like a fawning suitor than the "Hitler of
Asia."
Inevitably, of course, he made passes at her. She was an attractive
woman. First there was the hand on top of her hand, then a stolen kiss. She
spurned him every time, making it clear she was happily married, but she
was worried: if all he had wanted was an affair, the whole book deal could
fall apart. Once again, though, her straightforward strategy seemed the
right one. Surprisingly, he backed down without anger or resentment. He
promised that his affection for her would remain platonic. She had to admit
that he was not at all what she had expected, or what had been described to
her. Perhaps he liked being dominated by a woman.
The interviews continued for several months, and she noticed slight
changes in him. She still addressed him familiarly, spicing the conversation
with brazen comments, but now he returned them, delighting in this kind
of saucy banter. He assumed the same lively mood that she strategically
forced on herself. At first he had dressed in military uniform, or in his Italian suits. Now he dressed casually, even going barefoot, conforming to the
casual style of their relationship. One night he remarked that he liked the
color of her hair. It was Clairol, blue-black, she explained. He wanted to
have the same color; she had to bring him a bottle. She did as he asked,
imagining he was joking, but a few days later he requested her presence at
the palace to dye his hair for him. She did so, and now they had the exact
same hair color.

against people, as if they were stone walls. But instead of complaining
about how misunderstood or ignored you are, why not try something different: instead of seeing other people as spiteful or indifferent, instead of
trying to figure out why they act the way they do, look at them through
the eyes of the seducer. The way to lure people out of their natural intractability and self-obsession is to enter their spirit.
All of us are narcissists. When we were children our narcissism was
physical: we were interested in our own image, our own body, as if it were
a separate being. As we grow older, our narcissism grows more psychological: we become absorbed in our own tastes, opinions, experiences. A hard
shell forms around us. Paradoxically, the way to entice people out of this
shell is to become more like them, in fact a kind of mirror image of them.
You do not have to spend days studying their minds; simply conform to
their moods, adapt to their tastes, play along with whatever they send your
way. In doing so you will lower their natural defensiveness. Their sense of
self-esteem does not feel threatened by your strangeness or different habits.
People truly love themselves, but what they love most of all is to see their
ideas and tastes reflected in another person. This validates them. Their habitual insecurity vanishes. Hypnotized by their mirror image, they relax.
Now that their inner wall has crumbled, you can slowly draw them out,
and eventually turn the dynamic around. Once they are open to you, it becomes easy to infect them with your own moods and heat. Entering the
other person's spirit is a kind of hypnosis; it is the most insidious and effective form of persuasion known to man.
In the eighteenth-century Chinese novel The Dream of the Red Chamber, all the young girls in the prosperous house of Chia are in love with the
rakish Pao Yu. He is certainly handsome, but what makes him irresistible is
his uncanny ability to enter a young girl's spirit. Pao Yu has spent his youth
around girls, whose company he has always preferred. As a result, he never
comes over as threatening and aggressive. He is granted entry to girls'
rooms, they see him everywhere, and the more they see him the more they
fall under his spell. It is not that Pao Yu is feminine; he remains a man, but
one who can be more or less masculine as the situation requires. His familiarity with young girls allows him the flexibility to enter their spirit.
This is a great advantage. The difference between the sexes is what
makes love and seduction possible, but it also involves an element of fear
and distrust. A woman may fear male aggression and violence; a man is
often unable to enter a woman's spirit, and so he remains strange and
threatening. The greatest seducers in history, from Casanova to John F.
Kennedy, grew up surrounded by women and had a touch of femininity
themselves. The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, in his novel The Seducer's
Diary, recommends spending more time with the opposite sex, getting to
know the "enemy" and its weaknesses, so that you can turn this knowledge
to your advantage.

stacles were immense: she was spied on day and night. Still, Saltykov managed to befriend the young woman, and to enter her all-too-small circle.
He finally got her alone, and made it clear to her how well he understood
her loneliness, how deeply he disliked her husband, and how much he
shared her interest in the new ideas that were sweeping Europe. Soon he
found himself able to arrange further meetings, where he gave her the impression that when he was with her, nothing else in the world mattered.
Catherine fell deeply in love with him, and he did in fact become her first
lover. Saltykov had entered her spirit.

Chateaubriand would reawaken the fantasy they had had as young girls of

Hunter's Mirror. The lark is a savory bird, but difficult to catch. In the field, the
hunter places a mirror on a stand. The lark lands in
front of the glass, steps back and forth, entranced by its own

surroundings, until the hunter's net traps it against the mirror.

Enter Their Spirit •

Reversal
n 1897 in Berlin, the poet Rainer Maria Rilke, whose reputation would
later circle the world, met Lou Andreas-Salomé, the Russian-born writer
and beauty who was notorious for having broken Nietzsche's heart. She
was the darling of Berlin intellectuals, and although Rilke was twenty-two
and she was thirty-six, he fell head over heels in love with her. He flooded
her with love letters, which showed that he had read all her books and
knew her tastes intimately. The two became friends. Soon she was editing
his poetry, and he hung on her every word.
Salomé was flattered by Rilke's mirroring of her spirit, enchanted by
the intense attention he paid her and the spiritual communion they began
to develop. She became his lover. But she was worried about his future; it
was difficult to make a living as a poet, and she encouraged him to learn
her native language, Russian, and become a translator. He followed her advice so avidly that within months he could speak Russian. They visited
Russia together, and Rilke was overwhelmed by what he saw—the peasants, the folk customs, the art, the architecture. Back in Berlin, he turned
his rooms into a kind of shrine to Russia, and started wearing Russian peasant blouses and peppering his conversation with Russian phrases. Now the
charm of his mirroring soon wore off. At first Salomé had been flattered
that he shared her interests so intensely, but now she saw this as something
else: he seemed to have no real identity. He had become dependent on her
for his own self-esteem. It was all so slavish. In 1899, much to his horror,
she broke off the relationship.
The lesson is simple: your entry into a person's spirit must be a tactic, a
way to bring him or her under your spell. You cannot be simply a sponge,
soaking up the other person's moods. Mirror them for too long and they
will see through you and be repelled by you. Beneath the similarity to them
that you make them see, you must have a strong underlying sense of your
own identity. When the time comes, you will want to lead them into your
spirit; you cannot live on their turf. Never take mirroring too far, then. It is
only useful in the first phase of a seduction; at some point the dynamic
must be reversed.

Create Temptation

Lure the target deep into your seduction by creating the
proper temptation: a glimpse of the pleasures to come. As
the serpent tempted Eve with the promise of forbidden
knowledge, you must awaken a desire in your targets that they cannot control. Find that weakness
of theirs, that fantasy that has yet to be realized, and hint that you can lead them toward
it. It could be wealth, it could be adventure, it
could be forbidden and guilty pleasures; the
key is to keep it vague. Dangle the prize before
their eyes, postponing satisfaction, and let their
minds do the rest. The future seems ripe with possibility. Stimulate a curiosity stronger than the doubts
and anxieties that go with it, and they will follow you.

The Tantalizing Object
ome time in the 1880s, a gentleman named Don Juan de Todellas was
wandering through a park in Madrid when he saw a woman in her early
twenties getting out of a coach, followed by a two-year-old child and a
nursemaid. The young woman was elegantly dressed, but what took Don
Juan's breath away was her resemblance to a woman he had known nearly

had known, Cristeta Moreruela, was a showgirl in a second-rate theater. For these two crimes

Interpretation. Cristeta and Don Juan are characters in the novel Dulce y
Sabrosa (Sweet and Savory, 1891), by the Spanish writer Jacinto Octavio
Picon. Most of Picon's work deals with male seducers and their feminine
victims, a subject he studied and knew much about. Abandoned by Don
Juan, and reflecting on his nature, Cristeta decided to kill two birds with
one stone: she would get revenge and get him back. But how could she
lure such a man? The fruit once tasted, he no longer wanted it. What came
easily to him, or fell into his arms, held no allure for him. What would
tempt Don Juan into desiring Cristeta again, into pursuing her, was the
sense that she was already taken, that she was forbidden fruit. That was his
weakness—that was why he pursued virgins and married women, women
he was not supposed to have. To a man, she reasoned, the grass always
seems greener somewhere else. She would make herself that distant, alluring object, just out of reach, tantalizing him, stirring up emotions he could
not control. He knew how charming and desirable she had once been to
him. The idea of possessing her again, and the pleasure he imagined it
would bring, were too much for him: he swallowed the bait.
Temptation is a twofold process. First you are coquettish, flirtatious;
you stimulate a desire by promising pleasure and distraction from daily life.
At the same time, you make it clear to your targets that they cannot have
you, at least not right away. You are establishing a barrier, some kind of
tension.
In days gone by such barriers were easy to create, by taking advantage
of preexisting social obstacles—of class, race, marriage, religion. Today the
barriers have to be more psychological: your heart is taken by someone
else; you are really not interested in the target; some secret holds you back;
the timing is bad; you are not good enough for the other person; the other

Masetto began to consider
what steps he ought to take
so that he could go and

himself to be perfectly
capable of carrying out the
duties mentioned by Nuto,
he had no worries about
losing the job on that

afraid lest he should be
turned down because of his
youth and his unusually
attractive appearance. And
so, having rejected a
number of other possible
expedients, he eventually
thought to himself: "The
convent is a long way off,
and there's nobody there
who knows me. If I can
pretend to be dumb, they'll
take me on for sure."
Clinging firmly to this
conjecture, he therefore

person is not good enough for you; and so on. Conversely, you can choose
someone who has a built-in barrier: they are taken, they are not meant to
want you. These barriers are more subtle than the social or religious variety,
but they are barriers nevertheless, and the psychology remains the same.
People are perversely excited by what they cannot or should not have.
Create this inner conflict—there is excitement and interest, but you are
unavailable—and you will have them grasping like Tantalus for water. And
as with Don Juan and Cristeta, the more you make your targets pursue you,
the more they imagine that it is they who are the aggressors. Your seduction is perfectly disguised.
The only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it.
—OSCAR WILDE.

Keys to Seduction
ost of the time, people struggle to maintain security and a sense of
balance in their lives. If they were always uprooting themselves in
pursuit of every new person or fantasy that passed them by, they could not
survive the daily grind. They usually win the struggle, but it does not come
easy. The world is full of temptation. They read about people who have
more than they do, about adventures others are having, about people who
have found wealth and happiness. The security that they strive for, and that
they seem to have in their lives, is actually an illusion. It covers up a constant tension.
As a seducer, you can never mistake people's appearance for reality. You
know that their fight to keep order in their lives is exhausting, and that they
are gnawed by doubts and regrets. It is hard to be good and virtuous, always
having to repress the strongest desires. With that knowledge in mind, seduction is easier. What people want is not temptation; temptation happens
every day. What people want is to give into temptation, to yield. That is the
only way to get rid of the tension in their lives. It costs much more to resist
temptation than to surrender.
Your task, then, is to create a temptation that is stronger than the daily
variety. It has to be focused on them, aimed at them as individuals—at their
weakness. Understand: everyone has a principal weakness, from which others stem. Find that childhood insecurity, that lack in their life, and you hold
the key to tempting them. Their weakness may be greed, vanity, boredom,
some deeply repressed desire, a hunger for forbidden fruit. They signal it in
little details that elude their conscious control: their style of clothing, an
offhand comment. Their past, and particularly their past romances, will be
littered with clues. Give them a potent temptation, tailored to their weakness, and you can make the hope of pleasure that you stir in them figure
more prominently than the doubts and anxieties that accompany it.
In 1621, King Philip III of Spain desperately wanted to forge an al-

liance with England by marrying his daughter to the son of the English
king, James I. James seemed open to the idea, but he stalled for time.
Spain's ambassador to the English court, a man called Gondomar, was given
the task of advancing Philip's plan. He set his sights on the king's favorite,
the Duke (former Earl) of Buckingham.
Gondomar knew the duke's main weakness: vanity. Buckingham hungered for the glory and adventure that would add to his fame; he was bored
with his limited tasks, and he pouted and whined about this. The ambassador first flattered him profusely—the duke was the ablest man in the
country and it was a shame he was given so little to do. Then, he began to
whisper to him of a great adventure. The duke, as Gondomar knew, was in
favor of the match with the Spanish princess, but these damned marriage
negotiations with King James were taking so long, and getting nowhere.
What if the duke were to accompany the king's son, his good friend Prince
Charles, to Spain? Of course, this would have to be done in secret, without
guards or escorts, for the English government and its ministers would never
sanction such a trip. But that would make it all the more dangerous and romantic. Once in Madrid, the prince could throw himself at Princess
Maria's feet, declare his undying love, and carry her back to England in triumph. What a chivalrous deed it would be and all for love. The duke
would get all the credit and it would make his name famous for centuries.
The duke fell for the idea, and convinced Charles to go along; after
much arguing, they also convinced a reluctant King James. The trip was a
near disaster (Charles would have had to convert to Catholicism to win
Maria), and the marriage never happened, but Gondomar had done his job.
He did not bribe the duke with offers of money or power—he aimed at
the childlike part of him that never grew up. A child has little power to resist. It wants everything, now, and rarely thinks of the consequences. A
child lies lurking in everyone—a pleasure that was denied them, a desire
that was repressed. Hit at that point, tempt them with the proper toy (adventure, money, fun), and they will slough off their normal adult reasonableness. Recognize their weakness by whatever childlike behavior they
reveal in daily life—it is the tip of the iceberg.
Napoleon Bonaparte was appointed the supreme general of the French
army in 1796. His commission was to defeat the Austrian forces that had
taken over northern Italy. The obstacles were immense: Napoleon was only
twenty-six at the time; the generals below him were envious of his position
and doubtful of his abilities. His soldiers were tired, underfed, underpaid,
and grumpy. How could he motivate this group to fight the highly experienced Austrian army? As he prepared to cross the Alps into Italy, Napoleon
gave a speech to his troops that may have been the turning point in his career, and in his life: "Soldiers, you are half starved and half naked. The government owes you much, but can do nothing for you. Your patience, your
courage, do you honor, but give you no glory. . . . I will lead you into the
most fertile plains of the world. There you will find flourishing cities,
teeming provinces. There you will reap honor, glory, and wealth." The

The Art of Seduction

Reversal

T

he reverse of temptation is security or satisfaction, and both are fatal to
seduction. If you cannot tempt someone out of their habitual comfort, you cannot seduce them. If you satisfy the desire you have awakened,
the seduction is over. There is no reversal to temptation. Although some
stages can be passed over, no seduction can proceed without some form of
temptation, so it is always better to plan it carefully, tailoring it to the weakness and childishness in your particular target.

Phase Two

Lead Astray—
Creating Pleasure and Confusion
Your victims are sufficiently intrigued and their desire for you is
growing, but their attachment is weak and at any moment they could
decide to turn back. The goal in this phase is to lead your victims so
far astray—keeping them emotional and confused, giving them pleasure but making them want more—that retreat is no longer possible.
Springing on them a pleasant surprise will make them see you as delightfully unpredictable, but will also keep them off balance (9: Keep
them in suspense—what comes next?). The artful use of soft and
pleasant words will intoxicate them and stimulate fantasies (10: Use
the demonic power of words to sow confusion). Aesthetic touches and
pleasant little rituals will titillate their senses, distract their minds
(11: Pay attention to detail).

Your greatest danger in this phase is the mere hint of routine or familiarity. You need to maintain some mystery, to keep a little distance so
that in your absence your victims become obsessed with you (12: Poeticize your presence). They may realize they are falling for you, but
they must never suspect how much of this has come from your manipulations. A well-timed display of your weakness, of how emotional you
have become under their influence will help cover your tracks (13: Disarm through strategic weakness and vulnerability). To excite your victims and make them highly emotional, you must give them the feeling
that they are actually living some of the fantasies you have stirred in
their imagination (14: Confuse desire and reality). By giving them
only a part of the fantasy, you will keep them coming back for more.
Focusing your attention on them so that the rest of the world fades
away, even taking them on a trip, will lead them far astray (15: Isolate
your victim). There is no turning back.

Keep Them in SuspenseWhat Comes Next?

The moment people feel they know what to expect from
you, your spell on them is broken. More: you have ceded
them power. The only way to lead the seduced along and
keep the upper hand is to create suspense, a calculated surprise. People love a mystery, and this is the key to luring
them further into your web. Behave in a way that leaves
them wondering, What are you up to? Doing something
they do not expect from you will give them a delightful
sense of spontaneity—they will not be able to foresee what comes next. You are always one step
ahead and in control. Give the victim a
thrill with a sudden change of
direction.

The Calculated Surprise

I

n 1753, the twenty-eight-old Giovanni Casanova met a young girl
named Caterina with whom he fell in love. Her father knew what kind
of man Casanova was, and to prevent some mishap before he could marry
her off, he sent her away to a convent on the Venetian island of Murano,
where she was to remain for four years.
Casanova, however, was not one to be daunted. He smuggled letters to I count upon taking [the

friend, who is also absolutely my master," she replied. "It is to him I owe
my wealth." She asked if he had a lover. Yes, he replied. She then said, in a
mysterious tone, "I warn you that if you once allow me to take her place in
your heart, no power on earth can tear me from it." She then gave him the
key to the villa and told him to meet her there in two nights. He kissed her
through the grating and left in a daze. "I passed the next two days in a state
of feverish impatience," he wrote, "which prevented me from sleeping or
eating. Over and above birth, beauty, and wit, my new conquest possessed
an additional charm: she was forbidden fruit. I was about to become a rival
of the Church." He imagined her in her habit, and with her shaven head.
He arrived at the villa at the appointed hour. Mathilde was waiting for
him. To his surprise, she wore an elegant dress, and somehow she had
avoided having her head shaved, for her hair was in a magnificent chignon.
Casanova began to kiss her. She resisted, but only slightly, and then pulled
back, saying a meal was ready for them. Over dinner she filled in a few
more of the gaps: her money allowed her to bribe certain people, so that
she could escape from the convent every so often. She had mentioned
Casanova to her friend and master, and he had approved their liaison. He
must be old? Casanova asked. No, she replied, a glint in her eye, he is in his
forties, and quite handsome. After supper, a bell rang—her signal to hurry
back to the convent, or she would be caught. She changed back into her
habit and left.

find that he was embracing Caterina, dressed up in Mathilde's clothes.
Mathilde had befriended Caterina and learned her story. Apparently taking
pity on her, she had arranged it so that Caterina could leave the convent for
the evening, and meet up with Casanova. Only a few months before
Casanova had been in love with this girl, but he had forgotten about her.
Compared to the ingenious Mathilde, Caterina was a simpering bore. He
could not conceal his disappointment. He burned to see Mathilde.
Casanova was angry at the trick Mathilde had played. But a few days
later, when he saw her again, all was forgiven. As she had predicted during
their first interview, her power over him was complete. He had become her
slave, addicted to her whims, and to the dangerous pleasures she offered.
Who knows what rash act he might have committed on her behalf had
their affair not been cut short by circumstance.

Interpretation. Casanova was almost always in control in his seductions.
He was the one who led, taking his victim on a trip to an unknown destination, luring her into his web. In all of his memoirs the story of Mathilde
is the only seduction in which the tables are happily turned: he is the seduced, the bewildered victim.
What made Casanova Mathilde's slave was the same tactic he had used
on countless girls: the irresistible lure of being led by another person, the
thrill of being surprised, the power of mystery. Each time he left Mathilde
his head was spinning with questions. Her ability to go on surprising him
kept her always in his mind, deepening her spell and blotting Caterina out.
Each surprise was carefully calculated for the effect it would produce. The
first unexpected letter piqued his curiosity, as did that first sight of her in
the waiting room; suddenly seeing her dressed as an elegant woman stirred
intense desire; then seeing her dressed as a man intensified the excitingly
transgressive nature of their liaison. The surprises put him off balance, yet
left him quivering with anticipation of the next one. Even an unpleasant
surprise, such as the encounter with Caterina that Mathilde had set up, kept
him emotional and weak. Meeting the somewhat bland Caterina at that
moment only made him long that much more for Mathilde.
In seduction, you need to create constant tension and suspense, a feeling that with you nothing is predictable. Do not think of this as a painful
challenge. You are creating drama in real life, so pour your creative energies
into it, have some fun. There are all kinds of calculated surprises you can
spring on your victims—sending a letter from out of the blue, showing up
unexpectedly, taking them to a place they have never been. But best of all
are surprises that reveal something new about your character. This needs to
be set up. In those first few weeks, your targets will tend to make certain
snap judgments about you, based on appearances. Perhaps they see you as
a bit shy, practical, puritanical. You know that this is not the real you, but it
is how you act in social situations. Let them, however, have these impressions, and in fact accentuate them a little, without overacting: for instance,

King Shahriyar put his

earnestly pleaded with her
against such a hazard; but
Shahrazad was resolved,
and would not yield to her

So the vizier arrayed his
daughter in bridal garments
and decked her with jewels
and made ready to

Shahrazad's

Before saying farewell to
her sister, Shahrazad gave
her these instructions:
"When I am received by
the king, I shall send for
you. Then when the king
has finished his act with
me, you must say: 'Tell
me, my sister, some tale of
marvel to beguile the
night.' Then I will tell you
a tale which, if Allah wills,
shall be the means of our

went with his daughter to
the king. And when the
king had taken the maiden
Shahrazad to his chamber
and had lain with her, she
wept and said: "I have a

The king sent for
Dunyazad. When she
arrived, she threw her arms

and seated herself by her
side. • Then Dunyazad
said to Shahrazad: "Tell
us, my sister, a tale of

may pass pleasantly." •
"Gladly," she answered,
"if the king permits. " •
And the king, who was

child is usually a willful, stubborn creature who will deliberately do
the opposite of what we ask. But there is one scenario in which children will happily give up their usual willfulness: when they are promised a
surprise. Perhaps it is a present hidden in a box, a game with an unforeseeable ending, a journey with an unknown destination, a suspenseful story
with a surprise finish. In those moments when children are waiting for a
surprise, their willpower is suspended. They are in your thrall for as long as
you dangle possibility before them. This childish habit is buried deep
within us, and is the source of an elemental human pleasure: being led by a
person who knows where they are going, and who takes us on a journey.
(Maybe our joy in being carried along involves a buried memory of being
literally carried, by a parent, when we are small.)
We get a similar thrill when we watch a movie or read a thriller: we are
in the hands of a director or author who is leading us along, taking us
through twists and turns. We stay in our seats, we turn the pages, happily
enslaved by the suspense. It is the pleasure a woman has in being led by a
confident dancer, letting go of any defensiveness she may feel and letting
another person do the work. Falling in love involves anticipation; we are
about to head off in a new direction, enter a new life, where everything
will be strange. The seduced wants to be led, to be carried along like a
child. If you are predictable, the charm wears off; everyday life is pre-

finishes, she quickly starts up another. She does this for nearly three years,
until the king finally decides to spare her life. You are like Shahrazad: with-

In 1765, Casanova met a young Italian countess named Clementina
who lived with her two sisters in a château. Clementina loved to read, and
had little interest in the men who swarmed around her. Casanova added
himself to their number, buying her books, engaging her in literary discussions, but she was no less indifferent to him than she had been to them.
Then one day he invited the entire family on a little trip. He would not tell
them where they were going. They piled into the carriage, all the way trying to guess their destination. A few hours later they entered Milan—what
joy, the sisters had never been there. Casanova led them to his apartment,
where three dresses had been laid out—the most magnificent dresses the
girls had ever seen. There was one for each of the sisters, he told them, and
the green one was for Clementina. Stunned, she put it on, and her face lit
up. The surprises did not stop—there was a delicious meal, champagne,
games. By the time they returned to the château, late in the evening,
Clementina had fallen hopelessly in love with Casanova.
The reason was simple: surprise creates a moment when people's defenses come down and new emotions can rush in. If the surprise is pleasurable, the seductive poison enters their veins without their realizing it. Any
sudden event has a similar effect, striking directly at our emotions before
we get defensive. Rakes know this power well.
A young married woman in the court of Louis XV, in eighteenthcentury France, noticed a handsome young courtier watching her, first at
the opera, then in church. Making inquiries, she found it was the Duc de
Richelieu, the most notorious rake in France. No woman was safe from
this man, she was warned; he was impossible to resist, and she should avoid
him at all costs. Nonsense, she replied, she was happily married. He could
not possibly seduce her. Seeing him again, she laughed at his persistence.
He would disguise himself as a beggar and approach her in the park, or his
coach would suddenly come alongside hers. He was never aggressive, and
seemed harmless enough. She let him talk to her at court; he was charming
and witty, and even asked to meet her husband.
The weeks passed, and the woman realized she had made a mistake: she
looked forward to seeing the marquis. She had let down her guard. This
had to stop. Now she started avoiding him, and he seemed to respect her
feelings: he stopped bothering her. Then one day, weeks later, she was at
the country manor of a friend when the marquis suddenly appeared. She
blushed, trembled, walked away, but his unexpected appearance had caught
her unawares—it had pushed her over the edge. A few days later she became another of Richelieu's victims. Of course he had set the whole thing
up, including the supposed surprise encounter.
Not only does suddenness create a seductive jolt, it conceals manipula-

tions. Appear somewhere unexpectedly, say or do something sudden, and
people will not have time to figure out that your move was calculated. Take
them to some new place as if it only just occurred to you, suddenly reveal
some secret. Made emotionally vulnerable, they will be too bewildered to
see through you. Anything that happens suddenly seems natural, and anything that seems natural has a seductive charm.
Only months after arriving in Paris in 1926, Josephine Baker had completely charmed and seduced the French public with her wild dancing. But
less than a year later she could feel their interest wane. Since childhood she
had hated feeling out of control of her life. Why be at the mercy of the
fickle public? She left Paris and returned a year later, her manner completely altered—now she played the part of an elegant Frenchwoman, who
happened to be an ingenious dancer and performer. The French fell in love
again; the power was back on her side. If you are in the public eye, you
must learn from this trick of surprise. People are bored, not only with their
own lives but with people who are meant to keep them from being bored.
The minute they feel they can predict your next step, they will eat you
alive. The artist Andy Warhol kept moving from incarnation to incarnation, and no one could predict the next one—artist, filmmaker, society
man. Always keep a surprise up your sleeve. To keep the public's attention,
keep them guessing. Let the moralists accuse you of insincerity, of having
no core or center. They are actually jealous of the freedom and playfulness
you reveal in your public persona.
Finally, you might think it wiser to present yourself as someone reliable,
not given to caprice. If so, you are in fact merely timid. It takes courage
and effort to mount a seduction. Reliability is fine for drawing people in,
but stay reliable and you stay a bore. Dogs are reliable, a seducer is not. If,
on the other hand, you prefer to improvise, imagining that any kind of
planning or calculation is antithetical to the spirit of surprise, you are making a grave mistake. Constant improvisation simply means you are lazy, and
thinking only about yourself. What often seduces a person is the feeling
that you have expended effort on their behalf. You do not need to trumpet
this too loudly, but make it clear in the gifts you make, the little journeys
you plan, the little teases you lure people with. Little efforts like these will
be more than amply rewarded by the conquest of the heart and willpower
of the seduced.

Symbol: The Roller Coaster.
The car rises slowly to the top, then suddenly hurtles you into
space, whips you to the side, throws you upside down, in every possible direction.
The riders laugh and scream. What thrills them is to let go, to grant control to someone else,
who propels them in unexpected directions. What new thrill awaits them around the next corner?

S

urprise can be unsurprising if you keep doing the same thing again and
again. Jiang Qing would try to surprise her husband Mao Zedong with
sudden changes of mood, from harshness to kindness and back. At first he
was captivated; he loved the feeling of never knowing what was coming.
But it went on for years, and was always the same. Soon, Madame Mao's
supposedly unpredictable mood swings just annoyed him. You need to vary
the method of your surprises. When Madame de Pompadour was the lover
of the inveterately bored King Louis XV, she made each surprise different—
a new amusement, a new game, a new fashion, a new mood. He could
never predict what would come next, and while he waited for the next surprise, his willpower was temporarily suspended. No man was ever more of
a slave to a woman than was Louis to Madame de Pompadour. When you
change direction, make the new direction truly new.

Seductive Oratory
n May 13, 1958, right-wing Frenchmen and their sympathizers in the
army seized control of Algeria, which was then a French colony.
They had been afraid that France's socialist government would grant Algeria its independence. Now, with Algeria under their control, they threatened to take over all of France. Civil war seemed imminent.
At this dire moment all eyes turned to General Charles de Gaulle, the

Interpretation. De Gaulle cared little about an old French colony, and
about what it symbolized to some French people. Nor did he have any
sympathy for anyone who fomented civil war. His one concern was to
make France a modern power. And so, when he went to Algiers, he had a
long-term plan: weaken the right-wingers by getting them to fight among
themselves, and work toward Algerian independence. His short-term goal
had to be to defuse the tension and buy himself some time. He would not
lie to the colonials by saying he supported their cause—that would cause
trouble back home. Instead he would beguile them with seductive oratory,
intoxicate them with words. His famous "I have understood you" could
easily have meant, "I understand what a danger you represent." But a jubilant crowd expecting his support read it the way they wanted. To keep
them at a fever pitch, de Gaulle made emotional references—to the French
Resistance during World War II, for example, and to the need for "discipline," a word with great appeal to right-wingers. He filled their ears with
promises—a new government, a glorious future. He got them to chant,
creating an emotional bond. He spoke with dramatic pitch and quivering
emotion. His words created a kind of delirium.
De Gaulle was not trying to express his feelings or speak the truth; he
was trying to produce an effect. This is the key to seductive oratory.
Whether you are talking to a single individual or to a crowd, try a little experiment: rein in your desire to speak your mind. Before you open your
mouth, ask yourself a question: what can I say that will have the most
pleasant effect on my listeners? Often this entails flattering their egos,
assuaging their insecurities, giving them vague hopes for the future, sympathizing with their travails ("I have understood you"). Start off with some— S Ø R E N KIERKEGAARD, thing pleasant and everything to come will be easy: people's defenses will

fused. Keep your language vague and ambiguous, letting your listeners fill
in the gaps with their fantasies and imaginings. Instead of tuning you out,
getting irritated or defensive, being impatient for you to shut up, they will
be pliant, happy with your sweet-sounding words.

Seductive Writing
ne spring afternoon in the late 1830s, in a street in Copenhagen, a
man named Johannes caught a glimpse of a beautiful young girl. Selfabsorbed yet delightfully innocent, she fascinated him, and he followed her,
from a distance, and found out where she lived. Over the next few weeks
he made inquiries and found out more about her. Her name was Cordelia
Wahl, and she lived with her aunt. The two led a quiet existence; Cordelia
liked to read, and to be alone. Seducing young girls was Johannes's specialty,
but Cordelia would be a catch: she had already turned down several eligible
suitors.
Johannes imagined that Cordelia might hunger for something more
out of life, something grand, something resembling the books she had
read and the daydreams that presumably filled her solitude. He arranged
an introduction and began to frequent her house, accompanied by a friend
of his named Edward. This young man had his own thoughts of courting Cordelia, but he was awkward, and strained to please her. Johannes,
on the other hand, virtually ignored her, instead befriending her aunt.
They would talk about the most banal things—farm life, whatever was in
the news. Occasionally Johannes would veer off into a more philosophical
discussion, for he had noticed, out of the corner of his eye, that on these
occasions Cordelia would listen to him closely, while still pretending to listen to Edward.
This went on for several weeks. Johannes and Cordelia barely spoke,
but he could tell that he intrigued her, and that Edward irritated her to no
end. One morning, knowing her aunt was out, he visited their house. It
was the first time he and Cordelia had been alone together. As dryly and
politely as possible, he proceeded to propose to her. Needless to say she was
shocked and flustered. A man who had shown not the slightest interest in
her suddenly wanted to marry her? She was so surprised that she referred
the matter to her aunt, who, as Johannes had expected, gave her approval.
Had Cordelia resisted, her aunt would have respected her wishes; but she
did not.
On the outside, everything had changed. The couple were engaged. Johannes now came to the house alone, sat with Cordelia, held her hand,
talked with her. But inwardly he made sure things were the same. He remained distant and polite. He would sometimes warm up, particularly
when talking about literature (Cordelia's favorite subject), but at a certain
point he always went back to more mundane matters. He knew this frustrated Cordelia, who had expected that now he would be different. Yet
even when they went out together, he took her to formal socials arranged
for engaged couples. How conventional! Was this what love and marriage
were supposed to be about, these prematurely aged people talking about
houses and their own drab futures? Cordelia, who was shy at the best of
times, asked Johannes to stop dragging her to these affairs.
The battlefield was prepared. Cordelia was confused and anxious.

Interpretation. Johannes and Cordelia are characters in the loosely autobiographical novel The Seducer's Diary (1843), by the Danish philosopher
Søren Kierkegaard. Johannes is a most experienced seducer, who specializes
in working on his victim's mind. This is precisely where Cordelia's previous

Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion • 257

suitors have failed: they have begun by imposing themselves, a common
mistake. We think that by being persistent, by overwhelming our targets
with romantic attention, we are convincing them of our affection. Instead
we are convincing them of our impatience and insecurity. Aggressive attention is not flattering because it is not personalized. It is unbridled libido at
work; the target sees through it. Johannes is too clever to begin so obviously. Instead, he takes a step back, intriguing Cordelia by acting a little
cold, and carefully creating the impression of a formal, somewhat secretive
man. Only then does he surprise her with his first letter. Obviously there is
more to him than she has thought, and once she has come to believe this,
her imagination runs rampant. Now he can intoxicate her with his letters,
creating a presence that haunts her like a ghost. His words, with their images and poetic references, are constantly in her mind. And this is the ultimate seduction: to possess her mind before moving to conquer her body.
The story of Johannes shows what a weapon in a seducer's armory a
letter can be. But it is important to learn how to incorporate letters in seduction. It is best not to begin your correspondence until at least several
weeks after your initial contact. Let your victims get an impression of you:
you seem intriguing, yet you show no particular interest in them. When
you sense that they are thinking about you, that is the time to hit them
with your first letter. Any desire you express for them will come as a surprise; their vanity will be tickled and they will want more. Now make your
letters frequent, in fact more frequent than your personal appearances. This
will give them the time and space to idealize you, which would be more
difficult if you were always in their face. After they have fallen under your
spell, you can always take a step back, making the letters fewer—let them
think you are losing interest and they will be hungry for more.
Design your letters as homages to your targets. Make everything you
write come back to them, as if they were all you could think about—a
delirious effect. If you tell an anecdote, make it somehow relate to them.
Your correspondence is a kind of mirror you are holding up to them—they
get to see themselves reflected through your desire. If for some reason they
do not like you, write to them as if they did. Remember: the tone of your
letters is what will get under their skin. If your language is elevated, poetic,
creative in its praise, it will infect them despite themselves. Never argue,
never defend yourself, never accuse them of being heartless. That would
ruin the spell.
A letter can suggest emotion by seeming disordered, rambling from one
subject to another. Clearly it is hard for you to think; your love has unhinged you. Disordered thoughts are exciting thoughts. Do not waste time
on real information; focus on feelings and sensations, using expressions that
are ripe with connotation. Plant ideas by dropping hints, writing suggestively without explaining yourself. Never lecture, never seem intellectual or
superior—you will only make yourself pompous, which is deadly. Far better to speak colloquially, though with a poetic edge to lift the language
above the commonplace. Do not become sentimental—it is tiring, and too

we return to yet another story about ourselves. As early as childhood we
learn to tune out this kind of noise (particularly when it comes from our
parents).
Music, on the other hand, is seductive, and gets under our skin. It is intended for pleasure. A melody or rhythm stays in our blood for days after we
have heard it, altering our moods and emotions, relaxing or exciting us. To
make music instead of noise, you must say things that please—things that relate to people's lives, that touch their vanity. If they have many problems,
you can produce the same effect by distracting them, focusing their attention
away from themselves by saying things that are witty and entertaining, or
that make the future seem bright and hopeful. Promises and flattery are music to anyone's ears. This is language designed to move people and lower
their resistance. It is language designed for them, not directed at them.
The Italian writer Gabriele D'Annunzio was physically unattractive, yet
women could not resist him. Even those who knew of his Don Juan reputation and disliked him for it (the actress Eleanora Duse and the dancer
Isadora Duncan, for instance) fell under his spell. The secret was the flow of
words in which he enveloped a woman. His voice was musical, his language
poetic, and most devastating of all, he knew how to flatter. His flattery was
aimed precisely at a woman's weaknesses, the areas where she needed validation. A woman was beautiful, yet lacked confidence in her own wit and
intelligence? He made sure to say that he was bewitched not by her beauty
but by her mind. He might compare her to a heroine of literature, or to a
carefully chosen mythological figure. Talking to him, her ego would double in size.
Flattery is seductive language in its purest form. Its purpose is not to
express a truth or a real feeling, but only to create an effect on the recipient.
Like D'Annunzio, learn to aim your flattery directly at a person's insecurities. For instance, if a man is a fine actor and feels confident about his professional skills, to flatter him about his acting will have little effect, and may
even accomplish the opposite—he could feel that he is above the need to
have his ego stroked, and your flattery will seem to say otherwise. But let us
say that this actor is an amateur musician or painter. He does this work on
his own, without professional support or publicity, and he is well aware that
others make their living at it. Flattery of his artistic pretensions will go
straight to his head and earn you double points. Learn to sniff out the parts
of a person's ego that need validation. Make it a surprise, something no one
else has thought to flatter before—something you can describe as a talent or
positive quality that others have not noticed. Speak with a little tremor, as if
your target's charms had overwhelmed you and made you emotional.
Flattery can be a kind of verbal foreplay. Aphrodite's powers of seduction, which were said to come from the magnificent girdle she wore, involved a sweetness of language—a skill with the soft, flattering words that
prepare the way for erotic thoughts. Insecurities and nagging self-doubts
have a dampening effect on the libido. Make your targets feel secure and alluring through your flattering words and their resistance will melt away.

• The Art of Seduction

Sometimes the most pleasant thing to hear is the promise of something
wonderful, a vague but rosy future that is just around the corner. President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in his public speeches, talked little about specific programs for dealing with the Depression; instead he used rousing
rhetoric to paint a picture of America's glorious future. In the various legends of Don Juan, the great seducer would immediately focus women's at—WILLIAM

them off. Tailor your sweet words to your targets' particular problems and
fantasies. Promise something realizable, something possible, but do not
make it too specific; you are inviting them to dream. If they are mired in
dull routine, talk of adventure, preferably with you. Do not discuss how it
will be accomplished; speak as if it magically already existed, somewhere in
the future. Lift people's thoughts into the clouds and they will relax, their
defenses will come down, and it will be that much easier to maneuver and
lead them astray. Your words become a kind of elevating drug.
The most anti-seductive form of language is argument. How many
silent enemies do we create by arguing? There is a superior way to get people to listen and be persuaded: humor and a light touch. The nineteenthcentury English politician Benjamin Disraeli was a master at this game. In
Parliament, to fail to reply to an accusation or slanderous comment was a
deadly mistake: silence meant the accuser was right. Yet to respond angrily,
to get into an argument, was to look ugly and defensive. Disraeli used a different tactic: he stayed calm. When the time came to reply to an attack, he
would slowly make his way to the speaker's table, pause, then utter a humorous or sarcastic retort. Everyone would laugh. Now that he had
warmed people up, he would proceed to refute his enemy, still mixing in
amusing comments; or perhaps he would simply move on to another subject, as if he were above it all. His humor took out the sting of any attack
on him. Laughter and applause have a domino effect: once your listeners
have laughed, they are more likely to laugh again. In this lighthearted mood
they are also more apt to listen. A subtle touch and a bit of irony give you
room to persuade them, move them to your side, mock your enemies. That
is the seductive form of argument.
Shortly after the murder of Julius Caesar, the head of the band of conspirators who had killed him, Brutus, addressed an angry mob. He tried to
reason with the crowd, explaining that he had wanted to save the Roman
Republic from dictatorship. The people were momentarily convinced—
yes, Brutus seemed a decent man. Then Mark Antony took the stage, and
he in turn delivered a eulogy for Caesar. He seemed overwhelmed with
emotion. He talked of his love for Caesar, and of Caesar's love for the
Roman people. He mentioned Caesar's will; the crowd clamored to hear it,
but Antony said no, for if he read it they would know how deeply Caesar
had loved them, and how dastardly this murder was. The crowd again insisted he read the will; instead he held up Caesar's bloodstained cloak, noting its rents and tears. This was where Brutus had stabbed the great general,
he said; Cassius had stabbed him here. Then finally he read the will, which

told how much wealth Caesar had left to the Roman people. This was the
coup de grace—the crowd turned against the conspirators and went off to
lynch them.
Antony was a clever man, who knew how to stir a crowd. According to
the Greek historian Plutarch, "When he saw that his oratory had cast a spell
over the people and that they were deeply stirred by his words, he began to
introduce into his praises [of Caesar] a note of pity and of indignation at
Caesar's fate." Seductive language aims at people's emotions, for emotional
people are easier to deceive. Antony used various devices to stir the crowd:
a tremor in his voice, a distraught and then an angry tone. An emotional
voice has an immediate, contagious effect on the listener. Antony also
teased the crowd with the will, holding off the reading of it to the end,
knowing it would push people over the edge. Holding up the cloak, he
made his imagery visceral.
Perhaps you are not trying to whip a crowd into a frenzy; you just want
to bring people over to your side. Choose your strategy and words carefully.
You might think it is better to reason with people, explain your ideas. But
it is hard for an audience to decide whether an argument is reasonable as
they listen to you talk. They have to concentrate and listen closely, which
requires great effort. People are easily distracted by other stimuli, and if
they miss a part of your argument, they will feel confused, intellectually inferior, and vaguely insecure. It is more persuasive to appeal to people's
hearts than their heads. Everyone shares emotions, and no one feels inferior
to a speaker who stirs up their feelings. The crowd bonds together, everyone contagiously experiencing the same emotions. Antony talked of Caesar as if he and the listeners were experiencing the murder from Caesar's
point of view. What could be more provocative? Use such changes of perspective to make your listeners feel what you are saying. Orchestrate your
effects. It is more effective to move from one emotion to another than to
just hit one note. The contrast between Antony's affection for Caesar and
his indignation at the murderers was much more powerful than if he had
stayed with one feeling or the other.
The emotions you are trying to arouse should be strong ones. Do not
speak of friendship and disagreement; speak of love and hate. And it is crucial to try to feel something of the emotions you are trying to elicit. You
will be more believable that way. This should not be difficult: imagine the
reasons for loving or hating before you speak. If necessary, think of something from your past that fills you with rage. Emotions are contagious; it is
easier to make someone cry if you are crying yourself. Make your voice an
instrument, and train it to communicate emotion. Learn to seem sincere.
Napoleon studied the greatest actors of his time, and when he was alone he
would practice putting emotion into his voice.
The goal of seductive speech is often to create a kind of hypnosis: you
are distracting people, lowering their defenses, making them more vulnerable to suggestion. Learn the hypnotist's lessons of repetition and affirmation, key elements in putting a subject to sleep. Repetition involves using

•

•

the same words over and over, preferably a word with emotional content:
"taxes," "liberals," "bigots." The effect is mesmerizing—ideas can be permanently implanted in people's unconscious simply by being repeated often
enough. Affirmation is simply the making of strong positive statements,
like the hypnotist's commands. Seductive language should have a kind of
boldness, which will cover up a multitude of sins. Your audience will be so
caught up in your bold language that they won't have time to reflect on
whether or not it is true. Never say "I don't think the other side made a
wise decision"; say "We deserve better," or "They have made a mess of
things." Affirmative language is active language, full of verbs, imperatives,
and short sentences. Cut out "I believe," "Perhaps," "In my opinion." Head
straight for the heart.
You are learning to speak a different kind of language. Most people
employ symbolic language—their words stand for something real, the feelings, ideas, and beliefs they really have. Or they stand for concrete things in
the real world. (The origin of the word "symbolic" lies in a Greek word
meaning "to bring things together"—in this case, a word and something
real.) As a seducer you are using the opposite: diabolic language. Your words
do not stand for anything real; their sound, and the feelings they evoke, are
more important than what they are supposed to stand for. (The word "diabolic" ultimately means to separate, to throw things apart—here, words and
reality.) The more you make people focus on your sweet-sounding language, and on the illusions and fantasies it conjures, the more you diminish
their contact with reality. You lead them into the clouds, where it is hard to
distinguish truth from untruth, real from unreal. Keep your words vague
and ambiguous, so people are never quite sure what you mean. Envelop
them in demonic, diabolical language and they will not be able to focus on
your maneuvers, on the possible consequences of your seduction. And the
more they lose themselves in illusion, the easier it will be to lead them
astray and seduce them.

Symbol: The Clouds. In the clouds it is hard to see
the exact forms of things. Everything seems vague;
the imagination runs wild, seeing things that are
not there. Your words must lift people into
the clouds, where it is easy for them
to lose their way.

Use the Demonic Power of Words to Sow Confusion

Reversal

D

o not confuse flowery language with seduction: in using flowery language you run the risk of wearing on people's nerves, of seeming
pretentious. Excess verbiage is a sign of selfishness, of your inability to rein
in your natural tendencies. Often with language, less is more; the elusive,
vague, ambiguous phrase leaves the listener more room for imagination
than does a sentence full of bombast and self-indulgence.
You must always think first of your targets, and of what will be pleasant
to their ears. There will be many times when silence is best. What you do
not say can be suggestive and eloquent, making you seem mysterious. In
the eleventh-century Japanese court diary The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon,
the counselor Yoshichika is intrigued by a lady he sees in a carriage, silent
and beautiful. He sends her a note, and she sends one back; he is the only
one to read it, but by his reaction everyone can tell it is in bad taste, or
badly written. It spoils the effect of her beauty. Shonagon writes, "I have
heard people suggest that no reply at all is better than a bad one." If you are
not eloquent, if you cannot master seductive language, at least learn to curb
your tongue—use silence to cultivate an enigmatic presence.
Finally, seduction has a pace and rhythm. In phase one, you are cautious
and indirect. It is often best to disguise your intentions, to put your target at
ease with deliberately neutral words. Your conversation should be harmless,
even a bit bland. In this second phase, you turn more to the attack; this is
the time for seductive language. Now when you envelop them in your seductive words and letters, it comes as a pleasant surprise. It gives them the
immensely pleasing feeling that they are the ones to suddenly inspire you
with such poetry and intoxicating words.

The Mesmerizing Effect
n December 1898, the wives of the seven major Western ambassadors to
China received a strange invitation: the sixty-three-year-old Empress
Dowager Tzu Hsi was hosting a banquet in their honor in the Forbidden
City in Beijing. The ambassadors themselves had been quite displeased
with the empress dowager, for several reasons. She was a Manchu, a race of

their breath away. The empress was seated on the Dragon Throne, which
was studded with jewels. She wore heavily brocaded robes, a magnificent

dress, she seemed a giant. She smiled at the ladies with much warmth and

The Sensuous Effect
ne day a messenger told Prince Genji—the aging but still consummate seducer in the Heian court of late-tenth-century Japan—that
one of his youthful conquests had suddenly died, leaving behind an orphan, a young woman named Tamakazura. Genji was not Tamakazura s father, but he decided to bring her to court and be her protector anyway.
Soon after her arrival, men of the highest rank began to woo her. Genji
had told everyone she was a lost daughter of his; as a result, they assumed
that she was beautiful, for Genji was the handsomest man in the court. (At
the time, men rarely saw a young girl's face before marriage; in theory, they
were allowed to talk to her only if she was on the other side of a screen.)
Genji showered her with attention, helping her sort through all the love
letters she was receiving and advising her on the right match.
As Tamakazura's protector, Genji was able to see her face, and she was
indeed beautiful. He fell in love with her. What a shame, he thought, to
give this lovely creature away to another man. One night, overwhelmed by

her charms, he held her hand and told her how much she resembled her
mother, whom he once had loved. She trembled—not with excitement,
however, but with fear, for although he was not her father, he was supposed
to be her protector, not a suitor. Her attendants were away and it was a
beautiful night. Genji silently threw off his perfumed robe and pulled her
down beside him. She began to cry, and to resist. Always a gentleman,
Genji told her that he would respect her wishes, he would always care for
her, and she had nothing to fear. He then politely excused himself.
Several days later Genji was helping Tamakazura with her correspondence when he read a love letter from his younger brother, Prince Hotaru,
who numbered among her suitors. In the letter, Hotaru berated Tamakazura for not letting him get physically close enough to talk to her and tell
her his feelings. Tamakazura had not replied; unused to the manners of the
court, she had felt shy and intimidated. As if to help her, Genji got one of
his servants to write to Hotaru in her name. The letter, written on beautiful perfumed paper, warmly invited the prince to visit her.
Hotaru appeared at the appointed hour. He smelled a beguiling incense, mysterious and seductive. (Mixed into this scent was Genji's own
perfume.) The prince felt a wave of excitement. Approaching the screen
behind which Tamakazura sat, he confessed his love for her. Without making a sound, she retreated to another screen, farther away. Suddenly there
was a flash of light, as if a torch had flared up, and Hotaru saw her profile
behind the screen: she was more beautiful than he had imagined. Two
things delighted the prince: the sudden, mysterious flash of light, and the
brief glimpse of his beloved. Now he was truly in love.
Hotaru began to court her assiduously. Meanwhile, feeling reassured that
Genji was no longer chasing her, Tamakazura saw her protector more often.
And now she could not help noticing little details: Genji's robes seemed to
glow, in pleasing and vibrant colors, as if dyed by unworldly hands. Hotaru's
robes seemed drab by comparison. And the perfumes burned into Genji's
garments, how intoxicating they were. No one else bore such a scent. Hotaru's letters were polite and well written, but the letters Genji sent her were
on magnificent paper, perfumed and dyed, and they quoted lines of poetry,
always surprising yet always appropriate for the occasion. Genji also grew
and gathered flowers—wild carnations, for instance—that he gave as gifts
and that seemed to symbolize his unique charm.
One evening Genji proposed to teach Tamakazura how to play the

For years after her entry
into the palace, a large
number of court-maidens
were especially set aside for
preparing Kuei-fei 's
dresses, which were chosen
and fashioned according to
the flowers of the season.
For instance, for New Year
(spring) she had blossoms
of apricot, plum and
narcissus; for summer, she
adopted the lotus; for
autumn, she patterned
them after the peony; for
winter, she employed the
chrysanthemum.
Of
jewelry she was fondest of
pearls, and the finest
products of the world found
their way into her boudoir
and were frequently
embroidered on her
numerous dresses. • Kueifei was the embodiment of
all that was lovely and
extravagant. No wonder
that no king, prince,
courtier or humble
attendant who ever met her
could resist the allurement
of her charms. Besides, she
was the most artful of
women and knew how to
use her natural gifts to the
best purpose. . . . The

supreme in the land and
with thousands of the most
handsome maidens to

suitors, the emperor himself—the more she realized that none could compare to Genji. He was supposed to be her protector, yes, that was still true,
but was it such a sin to fall in love with him? Confused, she found herself
giving in to the caresses and kisses that he began to surprise her with, now
that she was too weak to resist.

Interpretation. Genji is the protagonist in the eleventh-century novel The
Tale of Genji, written by Murasaki Shikibu, a woman of the Heian court.
The character was most likely inspired by the real-life seducer Fujiwara no
Korechika.
In his seduction of Tamakazura, Genji's strategy was simple: he would
make her realize indirectly how charming and irresistible he was by surrounding her with unspoken details. He also brought her in contact with
his brother; comparison with this drab, stiff figure would make Genji's superiority clear. The night Hotaru first visited her, Genji set everything up,
as if to support Hotaru's seducing—the mysterious scent, then the flash of
light by the screen. (The light came from a novel effect: earlier in the evening, Genji had collected hundreds of fireflies in a cloth bag. At the proper
moment he let them all go at once.) But when Tamakazura saw Genji encouraging Hotaru's pursuit of her, her defenses against her protector relaxed, allowing her senses to be filled by this master of seductive effects.
Genji orchestrated every possible detail—the scented paper, the colored
robes, the lights in the garden, the wild carnations, the apt poetry, the koto
lessons which induced an irresistible feeling of harmony. Tamakazura found
herself dragged into a sensual whirlpool. Bypassing the shyness and mistrust
that words or actions would only have worsened, Genji surrounded his
ward with objects, sights, sounds, and scents that symbolized the pleasure of
his company far more than his actual physical presence would have—in fact
his presence could only have been threatening. He knew that a young girl's
senses are her most vulnerable point.
The key to Genji's masterful orchestration of detail was his attention to
the target of his seduction. Like Genji, you must attune your own senses to
your targets, watching them carefully, adapting to their moods. You sense
when they are defensive and retreat. You also sense when they are giving in,
and move forward. In between, the details you set up—gifts, entertainments, the clothes you wear, the flowers you choose—are aimed precisely
at their tastes and predilections. Genji knew he was dealing with a young
girl who loved romantic novels; his wild flowers, koto playing, and poetry
brought their world to life for her. Attend to your targets' every move and
desire, and reveal your attentiveness in the details and objects you surround
them with, filling their senses with the mood you need to inspire. They can
argue with your words, but not with the effect you have on their senses.

hen we were children, our senses were much more active. The colors of a new toy, or a spectacle such as a circus, held us in thrall; a
smell or a sound could fascinate us. In the games we created, many of them
reproducing something in the adult world on a smaller scale, what pleasure
we took in orchestrating every detail. We noticed everything.
As we grow older our senses get dulled. We no longer notice as much,
for we are constantly hurrying to get things done, to move on to the next
task. In seduction, you are always trying to bring the target back to the
golden moments of childhood. A child is less rational, more easily de— T S A O H S U E H C H I N , ceived. A child is also more attuned to the pleasures of the senses. So when

WANG mally get in the real world, where we are all rushed, ruthless, out for ourselves. You need to deliberately slow things down, and return them to the
simpler times of their youth. The details that you orchestrate—colors, gifts,
little ceremonies—are aimed at their senses, at the childish delight we take
in the immediate charms of the natural world. Their senses filled with delightful things, they grow less capable of reason and rationality. Pay attention to detail and you will find yourself assuming a slower pace; your targets
will not focus on what you might be after (sexual favors, power, etc.) because you seem so considerate, so attentive. In the childish realm of the
senses in which you envelop them, they get a clear sense that you are involving them in something distinct from the real world—an essential ingredient of seduction. Remember: the more you get people to focus on the
little things, the less they will notice your larger direction. The seduction
will assume the slow, hypnotic pace of a ritual, in which the details have a
heightened importance and the moments are full of ceremony.
In eighth-century China, Emperor Ming Huang caught a glimpse of a
beautiful young woman, combing her hair beside an imperial pool. Her
name was Yang Kuei-fei, and even though she was the concubine of the
emperor's son, he had to have her for himself. Since he was emperor, nobody could stop him. The emperor was a practical man—he had many
concubines, and they all had their charms, but he had never lost his head
over a woman. Yang Kuei-fei, though, was different. Her body exuded the
most wonderful fragrance. She wore gowns made of the sheerest silk gauze,
each embroidered with different flowers, depending on the season. In
walking she seemed to float, her tiny steps invisible beneath her gown. She

W

Pay Attention to Detail

danced to perfection, wrote songs in his honor that she sang magnificently,
had a way of looking at him that made his blood boil with desire. She
quickly became his favorite.
Yang Kuei-fei drove the emperor to distraction. He built palaces for her,
spent all his time with her, satisfied her every whim. Before long his kingdom was bankrupt and ruined. Yang Kuei-fei was an artful seductress who
had a devastating effect on all of the men who crossed her path. There were
so many ways her presence charmed—the scents, the voice, the movements,
the witty conversation, the artful glances, the embroidered gowns. These
pleasurable details turned a mighty king into a distracted baby.
Since time immemorial, women have known that within the most apparently self-possessed man is an animal whom they can lead by filling his
senses with the proper physical lures. The key is to attack on as many fronts
as possible. Do not ignore your voice, your gestures, your walk, your
clothes, your glances. Some of the most alluring women in history have so
distracted their victims with sensual detail that the men fail to notice it is all
an illusion.
From the 1940s on into the early 1960s, Pamela Churchill Harriman
had a series of affairs with some of the most prominent and wealthy men in
the world—Averill Harriman (whom years later she married), Gianni Agnelli
(heir to the Fiat fortune), Baron Elie de Rothschild. What attracted these
men, and kept them in thrall, was not her beauty or her lineage or her vivacious personality, but her extraordinary attention to detail. It began with
her attentive look as she listened to your every word, soaking up your
tastes. Once she found her way into your home, she would fill it with your
favorite flowers, get your chef to cook that dish you had tasted only in the
finest restaurants. You mentioned an artist you liked? A few days later that
artist would be attending one of your parties. She found the perfect antiques for you, dressed in the way that most pleased or excited you, and she
did this without your saying a word—she spied, gathered information from
third parties, overheard you talking to someone else. Harriman's attention
to detail had an intoxicating effect on all the men in her life. It had something in common with the pampering of a mother, there to bring order
and comfort into their lives, attending to their needs. Life is harsh and
competitive. Attending to detail in a way that is soothing to the other person makes them dependent upon you. The key is probing their needs in a
way that is not too obvious, so that when you make precisely the right gesture, it seems uncanny, as if you had read their mind. This is another way of
returning your targets to childhood, when all of their needs were met.
In the eyes of women all over the world, Rudolph Valentino reigned
as the Great Lover through much of the 1920s. The qualities behind his
appeal certainly included his handsome, almost pretty face, his dancing
skills, the strangely exciting streak of cruelty in his manner. But his perhaps
most endearing trait was his time-consuming approach to courtship. His
films would show him seducing a woman slowly, with careful details—
sending her flowers (choosing the variety to match the mood he wanted to

• 273

induce), taking her hand, lighting her cigarette, escorting her to romantic
places, leading her on the dance floor. These were silent movies, and his
audiences never got to hear him speak—it was all in his gestures. Men came
to hate him, for their wives and girlfriends now expected the slow, careful
Valentino treatment.
Valentino had a feminine streak; it was said that he wooed a woman the
way another woman would. But femininity need not figure in this approach to seduction. In the early 1770s, Prince Gregory Potemkin began
an affair with Empress Catherine the Great of Russia that was to last many
years. Potemkin was a manly man, and not at all handsome. But he managed to win the empress's heart by the many little things he did, and continued to do long after the affair had begun. He spoiled her with wonderful
gifts, never tired of writing her long letters, arranged for all kinds of entertainments for her, composed songs to her beauty. Yet he would appear before her barefoot, hair uncombed, clothes wrinkled. There was no kind of
fussiness in his attention, which, however, did make it clear he would go to
the ends of the earth for her. A woman's senses are more refined than a
man's; to a woman, Yang Kuei-fei's overt sensual appeal would seem too
hurried and direct. What that means, though, is that all the man really has
to do is take it slowly, making seduction a ritual full of all kinds of little
things he has to do for his target. If he takes his time, he will have her eating out of his hand.
Everything in seduction is a sign, and nothing more so than clothes. It
is not that you have to dress interestingly, elegantly, or provocatively, but
that you have to dress for your target—have to appeal to your target's tastes.
When Cleopatra was seducing Mark Antony, her dress was not brazenly
sexual; she dressed as a Greek goddess, knowing his weakness for such fantasy figures. Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV, knew
the king's weakness, his chronic boredom; she constantly wore different
clothes, changing not only their color but their style, supplying the king
with a constant feast for his eyes. Pamela Harriman was subdued in the
fashions she wore, befitting her role as a high-society geisha and reflecting
the sober tastes of the men she seduced. Contrast works well here: at work
or at home, you might dress nonchalantly—Marilyn Monroe, for example,
wore jeans and a T-shirt at home—but when you are with the target you
wear something elaborate, as if you were putting on a costume. Your Cinderella transformation will stir excitement, and the feeling that you have
done something just for the person you are with. Whenever your attention
is individualized (you would not dress like that for anyone else), it is infinitely more seductive.
In the 1870s, Queen Victoria found herself wooed by Benjamin Disraeli, her own prime minister. Disraeli's words were flattering and his
manner insinuating; he also sent her flowers, valentines, gifts—but not just
any flowers or gifts, the kind that most men would send. The flowers were
primroses, symbols of their simple yet beautiful friendship. From then on,
whenever Victoria saw a primrose she thought of Disraeli. Or he would

Pay Attention to Detail

write on a valentine that he, "no longer in the sunset, but the twilight of
his existence, must encounter a life of anxiety and toil; but this, too, has its
romance, when he remembers that he labors for the most gracious of beings!" Or he might send her a little box, with no inscription, but with a
heart transfixed by an arrow on one side and the word "Fideliter," or
"Faithfully," on the other. Victoria fell in love with Disraeli.
A gift has immense seductive power, but the object itself is less important than the gesture, and the subtle thought or emotion that it communicates. Perhaps the choice relates to something from the target's past, or
symbolizes something between you, or merely represents the lengths you
will go to to please. It was not the money Disraeli spent that impressed Victoria, but the time he took to find the appropriate thing or make the appropriate gesture. Expensive gifts have no sentiment attached; they may
temporarily excite their recipient but they are quickly forgotten, as a child
forgets a new toy. The object that reflects its giver's attentiveness has a lingering sentimental power, which resurfaces every time its owner sees it.
In 1919, the Italian writer and war hero Gabriele D'Annunzio managed
to put together a band of followers and take over the town of Fiume, on
the Adriatic coast (now part of Slovenia). They established their own government there, which lasted for over a year. D'Annunzio initiated a series
of public spectacles that were to be immensely influential on politicians
elsewhere. He would address the public from a balcony overlooking the
town's main square, which would be full of colorful banners, flags, pagan
religious symbols, and, at night, torches. The speeches would be followed
by processions. Although D'Annunzio was not at all a Fascist, what he did
in Fiume crucially affected Benito Mussolini, who borrowed his Roman
salutes, his use of symbols, his mode of public address. Spectacles like these
have been used since then by governments everywhere, even democratic
ones. Their overall impression may be grand, but it is the orchestrated details that make them work—the number of senses they appeal to, the variety of emotions they stir. You are aiming to distract people, and nothing is
more distracting than a wealth of detail—fireworks, flags, music, uniforms,
marching soldiers, the feel of the crowd packed together. It becomes difficult to think straight, particularly if the symbols and details stir up patriotic
emotions.
Finally, words are important in seduction, and have a great deal of
power to confuse, distract, and boost the vanity of the target. But what is
most seductive in the long run is what you do not say, what you communicate indirectly. Words come easily, and people distrust them. Anyone can
say the right words; and once they are said, nothing is binding, and they
may even be forgotten altogether. The gesture, the thoughtful gift, the little
details seem much more real and substantial. They are also much more
charming than lofty words about love, precisely because they speak for
themselves and let the seduced read into them more than is there. Never
tell someone what you are feeling; let them guess it in your looks and gestures. That is the more convincing language.

forty-eight-year old colonel, Juan Perón, was named secretary of labor
and social affairs. Perón was a widow who had a fondness for young girls; at
the time of his appointment he was involved with a teenager whom he introduced to one and all as his daughter.
One evening in January of 1944, Perón was seated among the other

life. Her language was florid and theatrical; she surrounded him with attention, indeed to the point of suffocation, but a woman's dutiful service to a
great man was a classic image, and was celebrated in innumerable tango ballads. Yet she managed to remain elusive, mysterious, like a movie star you
see all the time on the screen but never really know. And when Perón was
finally alone, in prison, these poetic images and associations burst forth in
his mind. He idealized her madly; as far as he was concerned, she was no
longer an actress with a tawdry past. She seduced an entire nation the same
way. The secret was her dramatic poetic presence, combined with a touch
of elusive distance; over time, you would see whatever you wanted to in
her. To this day people fantasize about what Eva was really like.
Familiarity destroys seduction. This rarely happens early on; there is so
much to learn about a new person. But a midpoint may arrive when the
target has begun to idealize and fantasize about you, only to discover that
you are not what he or she thought. It is not a question of being seen too
often, of being too available, as some imagine. In fact, if your targets see
you too rarely, you give them nothing to feed on, and their attention may
be caught by someone else; you have to occupy their mind. It is more a
matter of being too consistent, too obvious, too human and real. Your targets cannot idealize you if they know too much about you, if they start to
see you as all too human. Not only must you maintain a degree of distance,
but there must be something fantastical and bewitching about you, sparking
all kinds of delightful possibilities in their mind. The possibility Eva held
out was the possibility that she was what in Argentine culture was considered the ideal woman—devoted, motherly, saintly—but there are any number of poetic ideals you can try to embody. Chivalry, adventure, romance,
and so on, are just as potent, and if you have a whiff of them about you,
you can breathe enough poetry into the air to fill people's minds with fantasies and dreams. At all costs, you must embody something, even if it is
roguery and evil. Anything to avoid the taint of familiarity and commonness.
What I need is a woman who is something, anything; either very beautiful or very kind or in the last resort very

The Art of Seduction

This need to idealize extends to our romantic entanglements, because
when we fall in love, or under the spell of another person, we see a reflection of ourselves. The choice we make in deciding to become involved
with another person reveals something important and intimate about us: we
resist seeing ourselves as having fallen for someone who is cheap or tacky or
tasteless, because it reflects badly on who we are. Furthermore, we are often
likely to fall for someone who resembles us in some way. Should that person be deficient, or worst of all ordinary, then there is something deficient
and ordinary about us. No, at all costs the loved one must be overvalued
and idealized, at least for the sake of our own self-esteem. Besides, in a
world that is harsh and full of disappointment, it is a great pleasure to be
able to fantasize about a person you are involved with.
This makes the seducer's task easy: people are dying to be given the
chance to fantasize about you. Do not spoil this golden opportunity by
overexposing yourself, or becoming so familiar and banal that the target
sees you exactly as you are. You do not have to be an angel, or a paragon of
virtue—that would be quite boring. You can be dangerous, naughty, even
somewhat vulgar, depending on the tastes of your victim. But never be ordinary or limited. In poetry (as opposed to reality), anything is possible.
Soon after we fall under a person's spell, we form an image in our
minds of who they are and what pleasures they might offer. Thinking of
them when we are alone, we tend to make this image more and more idealized. The novelist Stendhal, in his book On Love, calls this phenomenon
"crystallization," telling the story of how, in Salzburg, Austria, they used to
throw a leafless branch into the abandoned depths of a salt mine in the
middle of winter. When the branch was pulled out months later, it would
be covered with spectacular crystals. That is what happens to a loved one in
our minds.
According to Stendhal, though, there are two crystallizations. The first
happens when we first meet the person. The second and more important
one happens later, when a bit of doubt creeps in—you desire the other person, but they elude you, you are not sure they are yours. This bit of doubt
is critical—it makes your imagination work double, deepens the poeticizing
process. In the seventeenth century, the great rake the Duc de Lauzun
pulled off one of the most spectacular seductions in history—that of the

Perón, you must surround your targets with focused attention, so that in
those critical moments when they are alone, their mind is spinning with a
kind of afterglow. Do everything you can to keep the target thinking about
you. Letters, mementos, gifts, unexpected meetings—all these give you an
omnipresence. Everything must remind them of you.
Finally, if your targets should see you as elevated and poetic, there is
much to be gained by making them feel elevated and poeticized in their
turn. The French writer Chateaubriand would make a woman feel like a
goddess, she had such a powerful effect on him. He would send her poems
that she supposedly had inspired. To make Queen Victoria feel as if she
were both a seductive woman and a great leader, Benjamin Disraeli would
compare her to mythological figures and great predecessors, such as Queen
Elizabeth I. By idealizing your targets this way, you will make them idealize
you in return, since you must be equally great to be able to appreciate and

The Halo.

Slowly, when the target is alone, he or she begins to
imagine a kind of faint glow around your head, formed by all of
the possible pleasures you might offer, the radiance of your charged
presence, your noble qualities. The Halo separates you from other
people. Do not make it disappear by becoming familiar and ordinary.

Reversal
t might seem that the reverse tactic would be to reveal everything about
yourself, to be completely honest about your faults and virtues. This kind
of sincerity was a quality Lord Byron had—he almost got a thrill out of
disclosing all of his nasty, ugly qualities, even going so far, later on in his
life, as to tell people about his incestuous involvements with his half sister.
This kind of dangerous intimacy can be immensely seductive. The target
will poeticize your vices, and your honesty about them; they will start to
see more than is there. In other words, the idealization process is unavoidable. The only thing that cannot be idealized is mediocrity, but there is
nothing seductive about mediocrity. There is no possible way to seduce
without creating some kind of fantasy and poeticization.

Disarm Through Strategic Weakness
and Vulnerability

Too much maneuvering on your part may raise
suspicion. The best way to cover your tracks
is to make the other person feel superior and
stronger. If you seem to be weak, vulnerable, enthralled
by the other person, and unable to control yourself, you will
make your actions look more natural, less calculated. Physical
weakness—tears, bashfulness, paleness—will help create the effect. To further win trust, exchange honesty for virtue: establish
your "sincerity" by confessing some sin on your part—it doesn't
have to be real. Sincerity is more important than goodness. Play
the victim, then transform your target's sympathy into love.

awful sin.

Interpretation. The character of Valmont in Choderlos de Laclos's
epistolary novel Dangerous Liaisons is based on several of the great real-life
libertines of eighteenth-century France. Everything Valmont does is calculated for effect—the ambiguous actions that make Tourvel curious about
him, the act of charity in the village (he knows he is being followed), the
return visit to the château, the paleness of his face (he is having an affair
with a girl at the château, and their all-night carousals give him a wasted
look). Most devastating of all is his positioning of himself as the weak one,
the seduced, the victim. How can the Présidente imagine he is manipulating her when everything suggests he is simply overwhelmed by her beauty,
whether physical or spiritual? He cannot be a deceiver when he repeatedly
makes a point of confessing the "truth" about himself: he admits that his
charity was questionably motivated, he explains why he has gone astray, he
lets her in on his emotions. (All of this "honesty," of course, is calculated.)
In essence he is like a woman, or at least like a woman of those times—
emotional, unable to control himself, moody, insecure. She is the one who
is cold and cruel, like a man. In positioning himself as Tourvel's victim, Valmont can not only disguise his manipulations but elicit pity and concern.
Playing the victim, he can stir up the tender emotions produced by a sick
child or a wounded animal. And these emotions are easily channeled into
love—as the Présidente discovers to her dismay.
Seduction is a game of reducing suspicion and resistance. The cleverest
way to do this is to make the other person feel stronger, more in control of
things. Suspicion usually comes out of insecurity; if your targets feel superior and secure in your presence, they are unlikely to doubt your motives.
You are too weak, too emotional, to be up to something. Take this game as
far as it will go. Flaunt your emotions and how deeply they have affected
you. Making people feel the power they have over you is immensely flattering to them. Confess to something bad, or even to something bad that you
did, or contemplated doing, to them. Honesty is more important than
virtue, and one honest gesture will blind them to many deceitful acts. Create an impression of weakness—physical, mental, emotional. Strength and
confidence can be frightening. Make your weakness a comfort, and play
the victim—of their power over you, of circumstances, of life in general.
This is the best way to cover your tracks.
You know, a man ain't worth a damn if he can't cry at the
right time.

e all have weaknesses, vulnerabilities, frailnesses in our mental
makeup. Perhaps we are shy or oversensitive, or need attention—
whatever the weakness is, it is something we cannot control. We may try to
compensate for it, or to hide it, but this is often a mistake: people sense
something inauthentic or unnatural. Remember: what is natural to your
character is inherently seductive. A person's vulnerability, what they seem
to be unable to control, is often what is most seductive about them. People
who display no weaknesses, on the other hand, often elicit envy, fear, and
anger—we want to sabotage them just to bring them down.

tions: we cannot remain neutral. We feel sympathy, and most often will do
anything to stop the tears—including things that we normally would not
do. Weeping is an incredibly potent tactic, but the weeper is not always so
innocent. There is usually something real behind the tears, but there may
also be an element of acting, of playing for effect. (And if the target senses
this the tactic is doomed.) Beyond the emotional impact of tears, there is
something seductive about sadness. We want to comfort the other person,
and as Tourvel discovered, that desire quickly turns into love. Affecting sadness, even crying sometimes, has great strategic value, even for a man. It is a
skill you can learn. The central character of the eighteenth-century French
novel Marianne, by Marivaux, would think of something sad in her past to
make herself cry or look sad in the present.
Use tears sparingly, and save them for the right moment. Perhaps this
might be a time when the target seems suspicious of your motives, or when
you are worrying about having no effect on him or her. Tears are a sure
barometer of how deeply the other person is falling for you. If they seem
annoyed, or resist the bait, your case is probably hopeless.
In social and political situations, seeming too ambitious, or too controlled, will make people fear you; it is crucial to show your soft side. The
display of a single weakness will hide a multitude of manipulations. Emotion or even tears will work here too. Most seductive of all is playing the
victim. For his first speech in Parliament, Benjamin Disraeli prepared an
elaborate oration, but when he delivered it the opposition yelled and
laughed so loudly that hardly any of it could be heard. He plowed ahead
and gave the whole speech, but by the time he sat down he felt he had
failed miserably. Much to his amazement, his colleagues told him the
speech was a marvelous success. It would have been a failure if he had complained or given up; but by going ahead as he did, he positioned himself as
the victim of a cruel and unreasonable faction. Almost everyone sympathized with him now, which would serve him well in the future. Attacking

T

iming is everything in seduction; you should always look for signs that
the target is falling under your spell. A person falling in love tends to
ignore the other person's weaknesses, or to see them as endearing. An
unseduced, rational person, on the other hand, may find bashfulness or
emotional outbursts pathetic. There are also certain weaknesses that have
no seductive value, no matter how in love the target may be.
The great seventeenth-century courtesan Ninon de l'Enclos liked men
with a soft side. But sometimes a man would go too far, complaining that
she did not love him enough, that she was too fickle and independent, that
he was being mistreated and wronged. For Ninon, such behavior would
break the spell, and she would quickly end the relationship. Complaining,
whining, neediness, and actively appealing for sympathy will appear to your
targets not as charming weaknesses but as manipulative attempts at a kind of
negative power. So when you play the victim, do it subtly, without overadvertising it. The only weaknesses worth playing up are the ones that will
make you seem lovable. All others should be repressed and eradicated at all
costs.

Confuse Desire and Reality—
The Perfect Illusion

To
compensate for the difficulties in their
lives, people spend a lot of their time daydreaming, imagining a future full of adventure, success, and romance. If you can
create the illusion that through you they can live out their
dreams, you will have them at your mercy. It is important to start slowly, gaining their trust,
and gradually constructing the fantasy
that matches their desires. Aim at
secret wishes that have been thwarted
or repressed, stirring up uncontrollable
emotions, clouding their powers of reason. The
perfect illusion is one that does not depart too much from
reality, but has a touch of the unreal to it, like a waking dream,

no longer tell the difference between illusion
and reality.

Fantasy in the Flesh
n 1964, a twenty-year-old Frenchman named Bernard Bouriscout arrived in Beijing, China, to work as an accountant in the French embassy.
His first weeks there were not what he had expected. Bouriscout had
grown up in the French provinces, dreaming of travel and adventure.
When he had been assigned to come to China, images of the Forbidden
City, and of the gambling dens of Macao, had danced in his mind. But this

The two men became friends. Chinese contact with foreigners was restricted, but they managed to find ways to meet. One evening Bouriscout
tagged along when Pei Pu visited the home of a French official to tutor the
children. He listened as Pei Pu told them "The Story of the Butterfly," a
tale from the Chinese opera: a young girl yearns to attend an imperial
school, but girls are not accepted there. She disguises herself as a boy, passes
the exams, and enters the school. A fellow student falls in love with her,
and she is attracted to him, so she tells him that she is actually a girl. Like
most of these tales, the story ends tragically. Pei Pu told it with unusual
emotion; in fact he had played the role of the girl in the opera.
A few nights later, as they were walking before the gates of the Forbidden City, Pei Pu returned to "The Story of the Butterfly" "Look at my
hands," he said, "Look at my face. That story of the butterfly, it is my story
too." In his slow, dramatic delivery he explained that his mother's first two
children had been girls. Sons were far more important in China; if the third
child was a girl, the father would have to take a second wife. The third child
came: another girl. But the mother was too frightened to reveal the truth,
and made an agreement with the midwife: they would say that the child
was a boy, and it would be raised as such. This third child was Pei Pu.
Over the years, Pei Pu had had to go to extreme lengths to disguise her
sex. She never used public bathrooms, plucked her hairline to look as if she
were balding, on and on. Bouriscout was enthralled by the story, and also
relieved, for like the boy in the butterfly tale, deep down he felt attracted to
Pei Pu. Now everything made sense—the small hands, the high-pitched
voice, the delicate neck. He had fallen in love with her, and, it seemed, the
feelings were reciprocated.
Pei Pu started visiting Bouriscout's apartment, and soon they were
sleeping together. She continued to dress as a man, even in his apartment,
but women in China wore men's clothes anyway, and Pei Pu acted more
like a woman than any of the Chinese women he had seen. In bed, she had
a shyness and a way of directing his hands that was both exciting and feminine. She made everything romantic and heightened. When he was away
from her, her every word and gesture resonated in his mind. What made
the affair all the more exciting was the fact that they had to keep it secret.
In December of 1965, Bouriscout left Beijing and returned to Paris. He
traveled, had other affairs, but his thoughts kept returning to Pei Pu. The
Cultural Revolution broke out in China, and he lost contact with her. Before he had left, she had told him she was pregnant with their child. He had
no idea whether the baby had been born. His obsession with her grew too
strong, and in 1969 he finagled another government job in Beijing.
Contact with foreigners was now even more discouraged than on his
first visit, but he managed to track Pei Pu down. She told him she had
borne a son, in 1966, but he had looked like Bouriscout, and given the
growing hatred of foreigners in China, and the need to keep the secret of
her sex, she had him sent him away to an isolated region near Russia. It was
so cold there—perhaps he was dead. She showed Bouriscout photographs

surely in the imagination.

Interpretation. The moment Pei Pu met Bouriscout, he realized he had
found the perfect victim. Bouriscout was lonely, bored, desperate. The way
he responded to Pei Pu suggested that he was probably also homosexual, or
perhaps bisexual—at least confused. (Bouriscout in fact had had homosexual encounters as a boy; guilty about them, he had tried to repress this
side of himself.) Pei Pu had played women's parts before, and was quite
good at it; he was slight and effeminate; physically it was not a stretch. But
who would believe such a story, or at least not be skeptical of it?
The critical component of Pei Pu's seduction, in which he brought the
Frenchman's fantasy of adventure to life, was to start slowly and set up an
idea in his victim s mind. In his perfect French (which, however, was full of
interesting Chinese expressions), he got Bouriscout used to hearing stories
and tales, some true, some not, but all delivered in that dramatic yet believable tone. Then he planted the idea of gender impersonation with his
"Story of the Butterfly." By the time he confessed the "truth" of his gender, Bouriscout was already completely enchanted with him.
Bouriscout warded off all suspicious thoughts because he wanted to believe Pei Pu's story. From there it was easy Pei Pu faked his periods; it didn't

Wish Fulfillment
n 1762, Catherine, wife of Czar Peter III, staged a coup against her ineffectual husband and proclaimed herself empress of Russia. Over the next
few years Catherine ruled alone, but kept a series of lovers. The Russians
called these men the vremienchiki, "the men of the moment," and in 1774
the man of the moment was Gregory Potemkin, a thirty-five-year-old lieutenant, ten years younger than Catherine, and a most unlikely candidate for
the role. Potemkin was coarse and not at all handsome (he had lost an eye
in an accident). But he knew how to make Catherine laugh, and he worshiped her so intensely that she eventually succumbed. He quickly became
the love of her life.
Catherine promoted Potemkin higher and higher in the hierarchy,
eventually making him the governor of White Russia, a large southwestern
area including the Ukraine. As governor, Potemkin had to leave St. Petersburg and go to live in the south. He knew that Catherine could not do
without male companionship, so he took it upon himself to name Catherine's subsequent vremienchiki. She not only approved of this arrangement,
she made it clear that Potemkin would always remain her favorite.
Catherine's dream was to start a war with Turkey, recapture Constan-

tinople for the Orthodox Church, and drive the Turks out of Europe. She
offered to share this crusade with the young Hapsburg emperor, Joseph II,
but Joseph never quite brought himself to sign the treaty that would unite
them in war. Growing impatient, in 1783 Catherine annexed the Crimea, a
southern peninsula that was mostly populated by Muslim Tartars. She asked
Potemkin to do there what he had already managed to do in the Ukraine—
rid the area of bandits, build roads, modernize the ports, bring prosperity
to the poor. Once he had cleaned it up, the Crimea would make the perfect launching post for the war against Turkey
The Crimea was a backward wasteland, but Potemkin loved the challenge. Getting to work on a hundred different projects, he grew intoxicated
with visions of the miracles he would perform there. He would establish a
capital on the Dnieper River, Ekaterinoslav ("To the glory of Catherine"),
that would rival St. Petersburg and would house a university outshining
anything in Europe. The countryside would hold endless fields of corn, orchards with rare fruits from the Orient, silkworm farms, new towns with
bustling marketplaces. On a visit to the empress in 1785, Potemkin talked
of these things as if they already existed, so vivid were his descriptions. The
empress was delighted, but her ministers were skeptical—Potemkin loved
to talk. Ignoring their warnings, in 1787 Catherine arranged for a tour
of the area. She asked Joseph II to join her—he would be so impressed
with the modernization of the Crimea that he would immediately sign on
for the war against Turkey. Potemkin, naturally, was to organize the whole
affair.
And so, in May of that year, after the Dnieper had thawed, Catherine
prepared for a journey from Kiev, in the Ukraine, to Sebastopol, in the
Crimea. Potemkin arranged for seven floating palaces to carry Catherine
and her retinue down the river. The journey began, and as Catherine,
Joseph, and the courtiers looked at the shores to either side, they saw triumphal arches in front of clean-looking towns, their walls freshly painted;
healthy-looking cattle grazing in the pastures; streams of marching troops
on the roads; buildings going up everywhere. At dusk they were entertained by bright-costumed peasants, and smiling girls with flowers in their
hair, dancing on the shore. Catherine had traveled through this area many
years before, and the poverty of the peasantry there had saddened her—she
had determined then that she would somehow change their lot. To see before her eyes the signs of such a transformation overwhelmed her, and she
berated Potemkin's critics: Look at what my favorite has accomplished,
look at these miracles!
They anchored at three towns along the way, staying in each place in a
magnificent, newly built palace with artificial waterfalls in the English-style
gardens. On land they moved through villages with vibrant marketplaces;
the peasants were happily at work, building and repairing. Everywhere they
spent the night, some spectacle filled their eyes—dances, parades, mythological tableaux vivants, artificial volcanoes illuminating Moorish gardens.

that died a few days later. The palaces themselves were quickly and badly
built, but were so magnificently furnished that no one noticed. One
fortress along the way had been built of sand, and was destroyed a little later
by a thunderstorm.
The cost of this vast illusion had been enormous, and the war with
Turkey would fail, but Potemkin had accomplished his goal. To the observant, of course, there were signs along the way that all was not as it seemed,
but when the empress herself insisted that everything was real and glorious, the courtiers could only agree. This was the essence of the seduction:
Catherine had wanted so desperately to be seen as a loving and progressive
ruler, one who would defeat the Turks and liberate Europe, that when she
saw signs of change in the Crimea, her mind filled in the picture.
When our emotions are engaged, we often have trouble seeing things as
they are. Feelings of love cloud our vision, making us color events to coincide with our desires. To make people believe in the illusions you create,
you need to feed the emotions over which they have least control. Often
the best way to do this is to ascertain their unsatisfied desires, their wishes
crying out for fulfillment. Perhaps they want to see themselves as noble or
romantic, but life has thwarted them. Perhaps they want an adventure. If

something seems to validate this wish, they become emotional and irrational, almost to the point of hallucination.
Remember to envelop them in your illusion slowly. Potemkin did not
start with grand spectacles, but with simple sights along the way, such as
grazing cattle. Then he brought them on land, heightening the drama, until the calculated climax when the windows were flung open to reveal a
mighty war machine—actually a few thousand men and boats lined up in
such a way as to suggest many more. Like Potemkin, involve the target in
some kind of journey, physical or otherwise. The feeling of a shared adventure is rife with fantasy associations. Make people feel that they are getting
to see and live out something that relates to their deepest yearnings and
they will see happy, prosperous villages where there are only facades.
Here the real journey through Potemkin's fairyland began. It
was like a dream—the waking dream of some magician who
had discovered the secret of materializing his visions. . . .
[Catherine] and her companions had left the world of reality
behind. . . . Their talk was of Iphigenia and the ancient
gods, and Catherine felt that she was both Alexander and
Cleopatra.

he real world can be unforgiving: events occur over which we have little control, other people ignore our feelings in their quests to get what
they need, time runs out before we accomplish what we had wanted. If we
ever stopped to look at the present and future in a completely objective
way, we would despair. Fortunately we develop the habit of dreaming early
on. In this other, mental world that we inhabit, the future is full of rosy
possibilities. Perhaps tomorrow we will sell that brilliant idea, or meet the
person who will change our lives. Our culture stimulates these fantasies
with constant images and stories of marvelous occurrences and happy
romances.
The problem is, these images and fantasies exist only in our minds, or
on-screen. They really aren't enough—we crave the real thing, not this
endless daydreaming and titillation. Your task as a seducer is to bring some
flesh and blood into someone's fantasy life by embodying a fantasy figure,
or creating a scenario resembling that person's dreams. No one can resist
the pull of a secret desire that has come to life before their eyes. You must
first choose targets who have some repression or dream unrealized—always
the most likely victims of a seduction. Slowly and gradually, you will build
up the illusion that they are getting to see and feel and live those dreams of
theirs. Once they have this sensation they will lose contact with reality, and
begin to see your fantasy as more real than anything else. And once they

lose touch with reality, they are (to quote Stendhal on Lord Byron's female
victims) like roasted larks that fall into your mouth.
Most people have a misconception about illusion. As any magician
knows, it need not be built out of anything grand or theatrical; the grand
and theatrical can in fact be destructive, calling too much attention to you
and your schemes. Instead create the appearance of normality. Once your
targets feel secure—nothing is out of the ordinary—you have room to deceive them. Pei Pu did not spin the lie about his gender immediately; he
took his time, made Bouriscout come to him. Once Bouriscout had fallen
for it, Pei Pu continued to wear men's clothes. In animating a fantasy, the
great mistake is imagining it must be larger than life. That would border on
camp, which is entertaining but rarely seductive. Instead, what you aim for
is what Freud called the "uncanny," something strange and familiar at the
same time, like a deja vu, or a childhood memory—anything slightly irrational and dreamlike. The uncanny, the mix of the real and the unreal, has
immense power over our imaginations. The fantasies you bring to life for
your targets should not be bizarre or exceptional; they should be rooted in
reality, with a hint of the strange, the theatrical, the occult (in talk of destiny, for example). You vaguely remind people of something in their childhood, or a character in a film or book. Even before Bouriscout heard Pei
Pu's story, he had the uncanny feeling of something remarkable and fantastical in this normal-looking man. The secret to creating an uncanny effect
is to keep it subtle and suggestive.
Emma Hart came from a prosaic background, her father a country
blacksmith in eighteenth-century England. Emma was beautiful, but had
no other talents to her credit. Yet she rose to become one of the greatest
seductresses in history, seducing first Sir William Hamilton, the English
ambassador to the court of Naples, and then (as Lady Hamilton, Sir William's wife) Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson. What was strangest when you met
her was an uncanny sense that she was a figure from the past, a woman out
of Greek myth or ancient history. Sir William was a collector of Greek and
Roman antiquities; to seduce him, Emma cleverly made herself resemble a
Greek statue, and mythical figures in paintings of the time. It was not just
the way she wore her hair, or dressed, but her poses, the way she carried
herself. It was as if one of the paintings he collected had come to life. Soon
Sir William began to host parties in his home in Naples at which Emma
would wear costumes and pose, re-creating images from mythology and
history. Dozens of men fell in love with her, for she embodied an image
from their childhood, an image of beauty and perfection. The key to this
fantasy creation was some shared cultural association—mythology, historical
seductresses like Cleopatra. Every culture has a pool of such figures from
the distant and not-so-distant past. You hint at a similarity, in spirit and in
appearance—but you are flesh and blood. What could be more thrilling
than the sense of being in the presence of some fantasy figure going back
to your earliest memories?
One night Pauline Bonaparte, the sister of Napoleon, held a gala affair

Confuse Desire and Reality—The Perfect Illusion •

in her house. Afterward, a handsome German officer approached her in the
garden and asked for her help in passing along a request to the emperor.
Pauline said she would do her best, and then, with a rather mysterious look
in her eye, asked him to come back to the same spot the next night. The
officer returned, and was greeted by a young woman who led him to some
rooms near the garden and then to a magnificent salon, complete with an
extravagant bath. Moments later, another young woman entered through a
side door, dressed in the sheerest garments. It was Pauline. Bells were rung,
ropes were pulled, and maids appeared, preparing the bath, giving the officer a dressing gown, then disappearing. The officer later described the evening as something out of a fairy tale, and he had the feeling that Pauline
was deliberately acting the part of some mythical seductress. Pauline was
beautiful and powerful enough to get almost any man she wanted, and she
wasn't interested simply in luring a man into bed; she wanted to envelop
him in romantic adventure, seduce his mind. Part of the adventure was the
feeling that she was playing a role, and was inviting her target along into
this shared fantasy.
Role playing is immensely pleasurable. Its appeal goes back to childhood, where we first learn the thrill of trying on different parts, imitating
adults or figures out of fiction. As we get older and society fixes a role on
us, a part of us yearns for the playful approach we once had, the masks we
were able to wear. We still want to play that game, to act a different role in
life. Indulge your targets in this wish by first making it clear that you are
playing a role, then inviting them to join you in a shared fantasy. The more
you set things up like a play or a piece of fiction, the better. Notice how
Pauline began the seduction with a mysterious request that the officer reappear the next night; then a second woman led him into a magical series of
rooms. Pauline herself delayed her entrance, and when she appeared, she
did not mention his business with Napoleon, or anything remotely banal.
She had an ethereal air about her; he was being invited to enter a fairy
tale. The evening was real, but had an uncanny resemblance to an erotic
dream.
Casanova took role playing still further. He traveled with an enormous
wardrobe and a trunk full of props, many of them gifts for his targets—
fans, jewels, other accouterments. And some of the things he said and did
were borrowed from novels he had read and stories he had heard. He enveloped women in a romantic atmosphere that was heightened yet quite
real to their senses. Like Casanova, you must see the world as a kind of theater. Inject a certain lightness into the roles you are playing; try to create a
sense of drama and illusion; confuse people with the slight unreality of
words and gestures inspired by fiction; in daily life, be the consummate actor. Our culture reveres actors because of their freedom to play roles. It is
something that all of us envy.
For years, the Cardinal de Rohan had been afraid that he had somehow
offended his queen, Marie Antoinette. She would not so much as look at
him. Then, in 1784, the Comtesse de Lamotte-Valois suggested to him that

305

306

•

The Art of Seduction

the queen was prepared not only to change this situation but actually to befriend him. The queen, said Lamotte-Valois, would indicate this in her
next formal reception—she would nod to him in a particular way.
During the reception, Rohan indeed noticed a slight change in the
queen's behavior toward him, and a barely perceptible glance at him. He
was overjoyed. Now the countess suggested they exchange letters, and Rohan spent days writing and rewriting his first letter to the queen. To his delight he received one back. Next the queen requested a private interview
with him in the gardens of Versailles. Rohan was beside himself with happiness and anxiety. At nightfall he met the queen in the gardens, fell to the
ground, and kissed the hem of her dress. "You may hope that the past will
be forgotten," she said. At this moment they heard voices approaching, and
the queen, frightened that someone would see them together, quickly fled
with her servants. But Rohan soon received a request from her, again
through the countess: she desperately wanted to acquire the most beautiful
diamond necklace ever created. She needed a go-between to purchase it for
her, since the king thought it too expensive. She had chosen Rohan for the
task. The cardinal was only too willing; in performing this task he would
prove his loyalty, and the queen would be indebted to him forever. Rohan
acquired the necklace. The countess was to deliver it to the queen. Now
Rohan waited for the queen both to thank him and slowly to pay him
back.
Yet this never happened. The countess was in fact a grand swindler; the
queen had never nodded to him, he had only imagined it. The letters
he had received from her were forgeries, and not even very good ones. The
woman he had met in the park had been a prostitute paid to dress and act
the part. The necklace was of course real, but once Rohan had paid for it,
and handed it over to the countess, it disappeared. It was broken into parts,
which were hawked all over Europe for enormous amounts. And when
Rohan finally complained to the queen, news of the extravagant purchase
spread rapidly. The public believed Rohan's story—that the queen had indeed bought the necklace, and was pretending otherwise. This fiction was
the first step in the ruin of her reputation.
Everyone has lost something in life, has felt the pangs of disappointment. The idea that we can get something back, that a mistake can be
righted, is immensely seductive. Under the impression that the queen was
prepared to forgive some mistake he had made, Rohan hallucinated all
kinds of things—nods that did not exist, letters that were the flimsiest of
forgeries, a prostitute who became Marie Antoinette. The mind is infinitely vulnerable to suggestion, and even more so when strong desires are
involved. And nothing is stronger than the desire to change the past, right a
wrong, satisfy a disappointment. Find these desires in your victims and creating a believable fantasy will be simple for you: few have the power to see
through an illusion they desperately want to believe in.

Isolate the Victim

An isolated person is weak.
By slowly isolating your victims, you make them more vulnerable to your influence.

Their

isolation may be psychological: by filling
their field of vision through the pleasurable
attention you pay them, you crowd out everything else in their mind. They see and think
only of you. The isolation may also be physical: you take them away from their normal milieu, friends, family, home. Give them the
sense of being marginalized, in limbo—they
are leaving one world behind and entering
another. Once isolated like this, they have
no outside support, and in their confusion they are easily led astray.
Lure the seduced into your
lair, where nothing is
familiar.

Isolation—the Exotic Effect

I

n the early fifth century B.C., Fu Chai, the Chinese king of Wu, defeated
his great enemy, Kou Chien, the king of Yueh, in a series of battles. Kou
Chien was captured and forced to serve as a groom in Fu Chai's stables. He
was finally allowed to return home, but every year he had to pay a large
tribute of money and gifts to Fu Chai. Over the years, this tribute added

the king either for good
or ill. . . . • Amidst the
revelers in the halls of Wu,
Hsi Shih wove her net
of fascination about the
heart of the susceptible
monarch. . . . "Inflamed
by wine, she now begins to
sing / The songs of Wu to
please the fatuous king; /
And in the dance of Tsu
she subtly blends /All
rhythmic movements to her
sensuous ends." . . . But
she could do more than
sing and dance to amuse
the king. She had wit, and
her grasp of politics
astonished him. When
there was anything she
wanted she could shed tears
which so moved her lover's
heart that he could refuse
her nothing. For she was,
as Fan Li had said, the
one and only, the
incomparable Hsi Shih,
whose magnetic personality
attracted everyone, many
even against their own
will. . . . • Embroidered
silk curtains encrusted with
coral and gems, scented
furniture and screens inlaid
with jade and mother-ofpearl were among the
luxuries which surrounded
the favorite. . . . On one
of the hills near the palace
there was a celebrated pool
of clear water which has
been known ever since as
the pool of the king of
Wu. Here, to amuse her
lover, Hsi Shih would
make her toilet, using the
pool as a mirror while
the infatuated king combed
her hair. . . .

Shih comb her hair, using the pool as a mirror. He would watch her playing with her birds, in their jeweled cages, or simply walking through the
palace, for she moved like a willow in the breeze. The months went by; he
stayed in the palace. He missed councils, ignored his family and friends, neglected his public functions. He lost track of time. When a delegation came
to talk to him of urgent matters, he was too distracted to listen. If anything
but Hsi Shih took up his time, he worried unbearably that she would be
angry.
Finally word reached him of a growing crisis: the fortune he had spent
on the palace had bankrupted the treasury, and the people were discontented. He returned to the capital, but it was too late: an army from the
kingdom of Yueh had invaded Wu, and had reached the capital. All was
lost. Fu Chai had no time to rejoin his beloved Hsi Shih. Instead of letting
himself be captured by the king of Yueh, the man who had once served in
his stables, he committed suicide.
Little did he know that Kou Chien had plotted this invasion for years,
and that Hsi Shih's elaborate seduction was the main part of his plan.

Interpretation. Kou Chien wanted to make sure that his invasion of Wu
would not fail. His enemy was not Fu Chai's armies, or his wealth and his
resources, but his mind. If he could be deeply distracted, his mind filled
with something other than affairs of state, he would fall like ripe fruit.
Kou Chien found the most beautiful maiden in his realm. For three
years he had her trained in all of the arts—not just singing, dancing, and
calligraphy, but how to dress, how to talk, how to play the coquette. And it
worked: Hsi Shih did not allow Fu Chai a moment's rest. Everything about
her was exotic and unfamiliar. The more attention he paid to her hair, her
moods, her glances, the way she moved, the less he thought about diplomacy and war. He was driven to distraction.
All of us today are kings protecting the tiny realm of our own lives,
weighed down by all kinds of responsibilities, surrounded by ministers and
advisers. A wall forms around us—we are immune to the influence of other
people, because we are so preoccupied. Like Hsi Shih, then, you must lure
your targets away, gently, slowly, from the affairs that fill their mind. And
what will best lure them from their castles is the whiff of the exotic. Offer
something unfamiliar that will fascinate them and hold their attention. Be
different in your manners and appearance, and slowly envelop them in this

Isolation—The "Only You" Effect
n 1948, the twenty-nine-year-old actress Rita Hayworth, known as
Hollywood's Love Goddess, was at a low point in her life. Her marriage
to Orson Welles was breaking up, her mother had died, and her career
seemed stalled. That summer she headed for Europe. Welles was in Italy at
the time, and in the back of her mind she was dreaming of a reconciliation.
Rita stopped first at the French Riviera. Invitations poured in, particularly from wealthy men, for at the time she was considered the most beautiful woman in the world. Aristotle Onassis and the Shah of Iran telephoned
her almost daily, begging for a date. She turned them all down. A few days
after her arrival, though, she received an invitation from Elsa Maxwell, the
society hostess, who was giving a little party in Cannes. Rita balked but
Maxwell insisted, telling her to buy a new dress, show up a little late, and
make a grand entrance.
Rita played along, and arrived at the party wearing a white Grecian
gown, her red hair falling over her bare shoulders. She was greeted by a reaction she had grown used to: all conversation stopped as both men and
women turned in their chairs, the men gazing in amazement, the women
jealous. A man hurried to her side and escorted her to her table. It was
thirty-seven-year-old Prince Aly Khan, the son of the Aga Khan III, who
was the worldwide leader of the Islamic Ismaili sect and one of the richest
men in the world. Rita had been warned about Aly Khan, a notorious rake.
To her dismay, they were seated next to each other, and he never left her
side. He asked her a million questions—about Hollywood, her interests, on
and on. She began to relax a little and open up. There were other beautiful
women there, princesses, actresses, but Aly Khan ignored them all, acting as
if Rita were the only woman there. He led her onto the dance floor, and
though he was an expert dancer, she felt uncomfortable—he held her a little too close. Still, when he offered to drive her back to her hotel, she
agreed. They sped along the Grande Corniche; it was a beautiful night. For
one evening she had managed to forget her many problems, and she was
grateful, but she was still in love with Welles, and an affair with a rake like
Aly Khan was not what she needed.
Aly Khan had to fly off on business for a few days; he begged her to
stay at the Riviera until he got back. While he was away, he telephoned
constantly. Every morning a giant bouquet of flowers arrived. On the telephone he seemed particularly annoyed that the Shah of Iran was trying
hard to see her, and he made her promise to break the date to which she
had finally agreed. During this time, a gypsy fortune-teller visited the hotel,
and Rita agreed to have her fortune read. "You are about to embark on the

Keys to Seduction
he people around you may seem strong, and more or less in control of
their lives, but that is merely a facade. Underneath, people are more
brittle than they let on. What lets them seem strong is the series of nests
and safety nets they envelop themselves in—their friends, their families,
their daily routines, which give them a feeling of continuity, safety, and
control. Suddenly pull the rug out from under them, drop them alone into
some foreign place where the familiar signposts are gone or scrambled, and
you will see a very different person.
A target who is strong and settled is hard to seduce. But even the strongest people can be made vulnerable if you can isolate them from their nests
and safety nets. Block out their friends and family with your constant presence, alienate them from the world they are used to, and take them to
places they do not know. Get them to spend time in your environment. Deliberately disturb their habits, get them to do things they have never done.
They will grow emotional, making it easier to lead them astray. Disguise all
this in the form of a pleasurable experience, and your targets will wake up
one day distanced from everything that normally comforts them. Then
they will turn to you for help, like a child crying out for its mother when
the lights are turned out. In seduction, as in warfare, the isolated target is
weak and vulnerable.

attempting to seduce the novel's beautiful heroine. Clarissa is young, virtuous, and very much protected by her family. But Lovelace is a conniving seducer. First he courts Clarissa's sister, Arabella. A match between them
seems likely. Then he suddenly switches attention to Clarissa, playing on
sibling rivalry to make Arabella furious. Their brother, James, is angered by
Lovelace's change in sentiments; he fights with Lovelace and is wounded.
The whole family is in an uproar, united against Lovelace, who, however,
manages to smuggle letters to Clarissa, and to visit her when she is at the
house of a friend. The family finds out, and accuses her of disloyalty.
Clarissa is innocent; she has not encouraged Lovelace's letters or visits. But
now her parents are determined to marry her off, to a rich older man.
Alone in the world, about to be married to a man she finds repulsive, she
turns to Lovelace as the only one who can save her from this mess. Eventually he rescues her by getting her to London, where she can escape this
dreaded marriage, but where she is also hopelessly isolated. In these circumstances her feelings toward him soften. All of this has been masterfully
orchestrated by Lovelace himself—the turmoil within the family, Clarissa's
eventual alienation from them, the whole scenario.
Your worst enemies in a seduction are often your targets' family and
friends. They are outside your circle and immune to your charms; they may
provide a voice of reason to the seduced. You must work silently and subtly
to alienate the target from them. Insinuate that they are jealous of your target's good fortune in finding you, or that they are parental figures who have
lost a taste for adventure. The latter argument is extremely effective with
young people, whose identities are in flux and who are more than ready to
rebel against any authority figure, particularly their parents. You represent
excitement and life; the friends and parents represent habit and boredom.
In Shakespeare's The Tragedy of King Richard III, Richard, when still the
Duke of Gloucester, has murdered King Henry VI and his son, Prince Edward. Shortly thereafter he accosts Lady Anne, Prince Edward's widow,
who knows what he has done to the two men closest to her, and who hates
him as much as a woman can hate. Yet Richard attempts to seduce her. His
method is simple: he tells her that what he did, he did because of his love
for her. He wanted there to be no one in her life but him. His feelings were
so strong he was driven to murder. Of course Lady Anne not only resists
this line of reasoning, she abhors him. But he persists. Anne is at a moment
of extreme vulnerability—alone in the world, with no one to support her,
at the height of grief. Incredibly, his words begin to have an effect.
Murder is not a seductive tactic, but the seducer does enact a kind of
killing—a psychological one. Our past attachments are a barrier to the present. Even people we have left behind can continue to have a hold on us. As
a seducer you will be held up to the past, compared to previous suitors,
perhaps found inferior. Do not let it get to that point. Crowd out the past with
your attentions in the present. If necessary, find ways to disparage their previous lovers—subtly or not so subtly, depending on the situation. Even go
so far as to open old wounds, making them feel old pain and seeing by con-

Isolate the Victim

trast how much better the present is. The more you can isolate them from
their past, the deeper they will sink with you into the present.
The principle of isolation can be taken literally by whisking the target
off to an exotic locale. This was Aly Khan's method; a secluded island
worked best, and indeed islands, cut off from the rest of the world, have always been associated with the pursuit of sensual pleasures. The Roman
Emperor Tiberius descended into debauchery once he made his home on
the island of Capri. The danger of travel is that your targets are intimately
exposed to you—it is hard to maintain an air of mystery. But if you take
them to a place alluring enough to distract them, you will prevent them
from focusing on anything banal in your character. Cleopatra lured Julius
Caesar into taking a voyage down the Nile. Moving deeper into Egypt, he
was further isolated from Rome, and Cleopatra was all the more seductive.
The early-twentieth-century lesbian seductress Natalie Barney had an onagain-off-again affair with the poet Renée Vivien; to regain her affections,
she took Renée on a trip to the island of Lesbos, a place Natalie had visited
many times. In doing so she not only isolated Renée but disarmed and distracted her with the associations of the place, the home of the legendary
lesbian poet Sappho. Vivien even began to imagine that Natalie was Sappho herself. Do not take the target just anywhere; pick the place that will
have the most effective associations.
The seductive power of isolation goes beyond the sexual realm. When
new adherents joined Mahatma Gandhi's circle of devoted followers, they
were encouraged to cut off their ties with the past—with their family and
friends. This kind of renunciation has been a requirement of many religious sects over the centuries. People who isolate themselves in this way are
much more vulnerable to influence and persuasion. A charismatic politician feeds off and even encourages people's feelings of alienation. John F.
Kennedy did this to great effect when he subtly disparaged the Eisenhower
years; the comfort of the 1950s, he implied, compromised American ideals.
He invited Americans to join him in a new life, on a "New Frontier," full
of danger and excitement. It was an extremely seductive lure, particularly
for the young, who were Kennedy's most enthusiastic supporters.
Finally, at some point in the seduction there must be a hint of danger in
the mix. Your targets should feel that they are gaining a great adventure in
following you, but are also losing something—a part of their past, their
cherished comfort. Actively encourage these ambivalent feelings. An element of fear is the proper spice; although too much fear is debilitating, in
small doses it makes us feel alive. Like diving out of an airplane, it is exciting, a thrill, at the same time that it is a little frightening. And the only person there to break the fall, or catch them, is you.

The Art of Seduction

Symbol: The Pied Piper. A jolly fellow in his red and yellow cloak,
he lures the children from their homes with the delightful sounds of his
flute. Enchanted, they do not notice how far they are walking, how
they are leaving their families behind. They do not even notice the cave
he eventually leads them into, and which closes upon them forever.

Reversal
he risks of this strategy are simple: isolate someone too quickly and
you will induce a sense of panic that may end up in the target's taking
flight. The isolation you bring must be gradual, and disguised as pleasure—
the pleasure of knowing you, leaving the world behind. In any case, some
people are too fragile to be cut off from their base of support. The great
modern courtesan Pamela Harriman had a solution to this problem: she
isolated her victims from their families, their former or present wives, and
in place of those old connections she quickly set up new comforts for her
lovers. She overwhelmed them with attention, attending to their every
need. In the case of Averill Harriman, the billionaire who eventually married her, she literally established a new home for him, one that had no associations with the past and was full of the pleasures of the present. It is
unwise to keep the seduced dangling in midair for too long, with nothing
familiar or comforting in sight. Instead, replace the familiar things you have
cut them off from with a new home, a new series of comforts.

T

Phase Three

ThePrecipice—
Deepening the Effect Through
Extreme Measures

The goal in this phase is to make everything deeper—the effect you have
on their mind, feelings of love and attachment, tension within your victims. With your hooks deep into them, you can then push them back
and forth, between hope and despair, until they weaken and snap. Showing how far you are willing to go for your victims, doing some noble or
chivalrous deed (16: Prove yourself) will create a powerful jolt, spark an
intensely positive reaction. Everyone has scars, repressed desires, and unfinished business from childhood. Bring these desires and wounds to the
surface, make your victims feel they are getting what they never got as a
child and you will penetrate deep into their psyche, stir uncontrollable
emotions (17: Effect a regression). Now you can take your victims past
their limits, getting them to act out their dark sides, adding a sense of
danger to your seduction (18: Stir up the transgressive and taboo).

You need to deepen the spell, and nothing will more confuse and enchant
your victims than giving your seduction a spiritual veneer. It is not lust
that motivates you, but destiny, divine thoughts and everything elevated
(19: Use spiritual lures). The erotic lurks beneath the spiritual. Now
your victims have been properly set up. By deliberately hurting them,
instilling fears and anxieties, you will lead them to the edge of the
precipice from which it will be easy to push and make them fall (20: Mix
pleasure with pain). They feel great tension and are yearning for relief.

Prove Yourself

Most
people want to be seduced. If
they resist your efforts, it is probably because you have not gone far
enough to allay their doubts—about
your motives, the depth of your feelings, and so on. One well-timed action that shows how far you are
willing to go to win them over will
dispel their doubts. Do not worry
about looking foolish or making a
mistake—any

self-sacrificing and for your targets'
sake will so overwhelm their emotions, they won't notice anything else.
Never appear discouraged by people's
resistance, or complain. Instead, meet
the challenge by doing something extreme or chivalrous. Conversely, spur
others to prove themselves by making
yourself hard to reach, unattainable, worth fighting over.

much they care for us, and also for all oppressed peoples in the far

with a charlatan, or a hypocrite or a coward. Flattery and fine words can

greater effort is cherished
more dearly than what is
gained with little trouble.
As the proverb says:
'Prizes great cannot be
won unless some heavy
labor's done.'" • The
woman says: "If no great
prizes can be won unless
some heavy labor's done,
you must suffer the
exhaustion of many toils to
be able to attain the favors
you seek, since what you
ask for is a greater prize."
• The man says: "I give
you all the thanks that I

the love of so worthy a
woman without first

labors."

moments, or even manufacture them, as a kind of test: will you retreat? Or
will you rise to the occasion? You cannot hesitate or flinch, even for a moment, or all is lost. If necessary, make the deed seem to have cost you more
than it has, never with words, but indirectly—exhausted looks, reports
spread through a third party, whatever it takes.
The second way to prove yourself is the brave deed that you plan and
execute in advance, on your own and at the right moment—preferably
some way into the seduction, when any doubts the victim still has about
you are more dangerous than earlier on. Choose a dramatic, difficult action
that reveals the painful time and effort involved. Danger can be extremely
seductive. Cleverly lead your victim into a crisis, a moment of danger, or
indirectly put them in an uncomfortable position, and you can play the rescuer, the gallant knight. The powerful feelings and emotions this elicits can
easily be redirected into love.

Grammont knocked at the door, and a servant, mistaking him for the
duke, let him in. He headed straight for the lady's chamber, where he found
her lying on a couch, in a sheer gown. He threw off Brissac's cloak and she
gasped in fright. "What is the matter, my fair one?" he asked. "Your
headache, to all appearance, is gone?" She seemed put out, exclaimed she
still had the headache, and insisted that he leave. It was up to her, she said,
to make or break appointments. "Madam," Grammont said calmly, "I know
what perplexes you: you are afraid lest Brissac should meet me here; but
you may make yourself easy on that account." He then opened the window
and revealed Brissac out in the square, dutifully walking back and forth
with a horse, like a common stable boy. He looked ridiculous; de l'Orme
burst out laughing, threw her arms around the count, and exclaimed, "My
dear Chevalier, I can hold out no longer; you are too amiable and too eccentric not to be pardoned." He told her the whole story, and she promised
that the duke could exercise horses all night, but she would not let him in.
They made an appointment for the following evening. Outside, the count
returned the cloak, apologized for taking so long, and thanked the duke.
Brissac was most gracious, even holding Grammont's horse for him to
mount, and waving goodbye as he rode off.

Interpretation. Count Grammont knew that most would-be seducers give
up too easily, mistaking capriciousness or apparent coolness as a sign of a
genuine lack of interest. In fact it can mean many things: perhaps the person is testing you, wondering if you are really serious. Prickly behavior is
exactly this kind of test—if you give up at the first sign of difficulty, you
obviously do not want them that much. Or it could be that they themselves
are uncertain about you, or are trying to choose between you and someone
else. In any event, it is absurd to give up. One incontrovertible demonstration of how far you are willing to go will overwhelm all doubts. It will also
defeat your rivals, since most people are timid, worried about making fools
of themselves, and so rarely risk anything.
When dealing with difficult or resistant targets, it is usually best to improvise, the way Grammont did. If your action seems sudden and a surprise, it will make them more emotional, loosen them up. A little
roundabout accumulation of information—a little spying—is always a
good idea. Most important is the spirit in which you enact your proof. If
you are lighthearted and playful, if you make the target laugh, proving
yourself and amusing them at the same time, it won't matter if you mess
up, or if they see you have employed a little trickery. They will give in to
the pleasant mood you have created. Notice that the count never whined
or grew angry or defensive. All he had to do was pull back the curtain and
reveal the duke walking his horse, melting de l'Orme's resistance with
laughter. In one well-executed act, he showed what he would do for a
night of her favors.

His novels were often about war, and about the glory of facing and defeating death—an entertaining subject for someone who had never actually
done so. And so, at the start of World War I, no one was surprised that
D'Annunzio led the call for Italy to side with the Allies and enter the fray.
Everywhere you turned, there he was, giving a speech in favor of war—
a campaign that succeeded in 1915, when Italy finally declared war on
Germany and Austria. D'Annunzio's role so far had been completely predictable. But what did surprise the Italian public was what this fifty-twoyear-old man did next: he joined the army. He had never served in the
military, boats made him seasick, but he could not be dissuaded. Eventually
the authorities gave him a post in a cavalry division, hoping to keep him
out of combat.
Italy had little experience in war, and its military was somewhat
chaotic. The generals somehow lost track of D'Annunzio—who, in any

condition, assuring him
that if he fulfilled it she
would love him perfectly
forever; whereas, if he
failed in it, he would
certainly never win her as
long as he lived. And the
condition was this: she
would be willing to talk
with him, both being in
bed together, clad in their
linen only, but he was to
ask nothinginore from her
than words and kisses. •
He, thinking there was no
joy to be compared to that
which she promised him,
agreed to the proposal, and
that evening the promise
was kept; in such wise
that, despite all the caresses
she bestowed on him and
the temptations that beset
him, he would not break
his oath. And albeit his
torment seemed to him no
less than that of Purgatory,

yet was his love so great
and his hope so strong,
sure as he felt of the
ceaseless continuance of the
love he had thus painfully
won, that he preserved his
patience and rose from
beside her without having
done anything contrary to
her expressed wish. • The
lady was, I think, more
astonished than pleased by
such virtue; and giving no
heed to the honor, patience,
and faithfulness her lover
had shown in the keeping
of his oath, she forthwith
suspected that his love was
not so great as she had
thought, or else that he had
found her less pleasing
than he had expected. •
She therefore resolved,
before keeping her promise,
to make a further trial of
the love he bore her; and to
this end she begged him to
talk to a girl in her service,
who was younger than
herself and very beautiful,
bidding him make love
speeches to her, so that
those who saw him come so
often to the house might
think that it was for the
sake of this damsel and not
of herself • The young
lord, feeling sure that his
own love was returned in
equal measure, was wholly
obedient to her commands,
and for love of her
compelled himself to make
love to the girl; and she,
finding him so handsome
and well-spoken, believed
his lies more than other
truth, and loved him as
much as though she herself
were greatly loved by him.

matters were thus well
advanced, albeit the young
lord did not cease to claim
her promise, granted him
permission to come and see
her at one hour after
midnight, saying that after

case, had decided to leave his cavalry division and form units of his own.
(He was an artist, after all, and could not be subjected to army discipline.)
Calling himself Commandante, he overcame his habitual seasickness and directed a series of daring raids, leading groups of motorboats in the middle
of the night into Austrian harbors and firing torpedoes at anchored ships.
He also learned how to fly, and began to lead dangerous sorties. In August
of 1915, he flew over the city of Trieste, then in enemy hands, and dropped
Italian flags and thousands of pamphlets containing a message of hope, written in his inimitable style: "The end of your martyrdom is at hand! The
dawn of your joy is imminent. From the heights of heaven, on the wings of
Italy, I throw you this pledge, this message from my heart." He flew at altitudes unheard of at the time, and through thick enemy fire. The Austrians
put a price on his head.
On a mission in 1916, D'Annunzio fell against his machine gun, permanently injuring one eye and seriously damaging the other. Told his flying days were over, he convalesced in his home in Venice. At the time, the
most beautiful and fashionable woman in Italy was generally considered to
be the Countess Morosini, former mistress of the German Kaiser. Her
palace was on the Grand Canal, opposite the home of D'Annunzio. Now
she found herself besieged by letters and poems from the writer-soldier,
mixing details of his flying exploits with declarations of his love. In the
middle of air raids on Venice, he would cross the canal, barely able to see
out of one eye, to deliver his latest poem. D'Annunzio was much beneath
Morosini's station, a mere writer, but his willingness to brave anything on
her behalf won her over. The fact that his reckless behavior could get him
killed any day only hastened the seduction.
D'Annunzio ignored the doctors' advice and returned to flying, leading
even more daring raids than before. By the end of the war, he was Italy's
most decorated hero. Now, wherever in the nation he appeared, the public
filled the piazzas to hear his speeches. After the war, he led a march on
Fiume, on the Adriatic coast. In the negotiations to settle the war, Italians
believed they should have been awarded this city, but the Allies had not
agreed. D'Annunzio's forces took over the city and the poet became a
leader, ruling Fiume for more than a year as an autonomous republic. By
then, everyone had forgotten about his less-than-glorious past as a decadent
writer. Now he could do no wrong.

Interpretation. The appeal of seduction is that of being separated from our
normal routines, experiencing the thrill of the unknown. Death is the ultimate unknown. In periods of chaos, confusion, and death—the plagues
that swept Europe in the Middle Ages, the Terror of the French Revolution, the air raids on London during World War II—people often let go of
their usual caution and do things they never would otherwise. They experience a kind of delirium. There is something immensely seductive about

Prove Yourself • 329

danger, about heading into the unknown. Show that you have a reckless
streak and a daring nature, that you lack the usual fear of death, and you are
instantly fascinating to the bulk of humanity.
What you are proving in this instance is not how you feel toward another person but something about yourself: you are willing to go out on a
limb. You are not just another talker and braggart. It is a recipe for instant
charisma. Any political figure—Churchill, de Gaulle, Kennedy—who has
proven himself on the battlefield has an unmatchable appeal. Many had
thought of D'Annunzio as a foppish womanizer; his experience in the war
gave him a heroic sheen, a Napoleonic aura. In fact he had always been an
effective seducer, but now he was even more devilishly appealing. You do
not necessarily have to risk death, but putting yourself in its vicinity will
give you a seductive charge. (It is often best to do this some way into the
seduction, making it come as a pleasant surprise.) You are willing to enter
the unknown. No one is more seductive than the person who has had a
brush with death. People will be drawn to you; perhaps they are hoping
that some of your adventurous spirit will rub off on them.

4. According to one version of the Arthurian legend, the great knight Sir
Lancelot once caught a glimpse of Queen Guinevere, King Arthur's wife,
and that glimpse was enough—he fell madly in love. And so when word
reached him that Queen Guinevere had been kidnapped by an evil knight,
Lancelot did not hesitate—he forgot his other chivalrous tasks and hurried
in pursuit. His horse collapsed from the chase, so he continued on foot. Finally it seemed that he was close, but he was exhausted and could go no
farther. A horse-driven cart passed by; the cart was filled with loathsomelooking men shackled together. In those days it was the tradition to place
criminals—murderers, traitors, cowards, thieves—in such a cart, which
then passed through every street in town so that people could see it. Once
you had ridden in the cart, you lost all feudal rights for the rest of your life.
The cart was such a dreadful symbol that seeing an empty one made you
shiver and give the sign of the cross. Even so, Sir Lancelot accosted the
cart's driver, a dwarf: "In the name of God, tell me if you've seen my lady
the queen pass by this way?" "If you want to get into this cart I'm driving,"
said the dwarf, "by tomorrow you'll know what has become of the queen."
Then he drove the cart onward. Lancelot hesitated for but two of the
horse's steps, then ran after it and climbed in.
Wherever the cart went, townspeople heckled it. They were most curious about the knight among the passengers. What was his crime? How will
he be put to death—flayed? Drowned? Burned upon a fire of thorns? Finally the dwarf let him get out, without a word as to the whereabouts of
the queen. To make matters worse, no one now would go near or talk to
Lancelot, for he had been in the cart. He kept on chasing the queen, and all
along the way he was cursed at, spat upon, challenged by other knights. He

having so fully tested the
love and obedience he had
shown towards her, it was
but just that he should be
rewarded for his long
patience. Of the lover's joy
on hearing this you need
have no doubt, and he
failed not to arrive at the
appointed time. • But the
lady, still wishing to try the
strength of his love, had
said to her beautiful
damsel—"I am well aware
of the love a certain
nobleman bears to you,
and I think you are no less
in love with him; and I feel
so much pity for you both,
that I have resolved to
afford you time and place
that you may converse
together at your ease." •
The damsel was so
enchanted that she could
not conceal her longings,
but answered that she
would not fail to be
present. • In obedience,
therefore, to her mistress's
counsel and command, she
undressed herself and lay
down on a handsome bed,
in a room the door of
which the lady left half
open, whilst within she set
a light so that the maiden's
beauty might be clearly
seen. Then she herself
pretended to go away, but
hid herself near to the bed
so carefully that she could
not be seen. • Her poor
lover, thinking to find her
according to her promise,
failed not to enter the room
as softly as he could, at the
appointed hour; and after
he had shut the door and
put off his garments and
fur shoes, he got into the
bed, where he looked to
find what he desired. But
no sooner did he put out
his arms to embrace her
whom he believed to be his
mistress, than the poor girl,

own, had her arms round
his neck, speaking to him
the while in such loving
words and with so
beautiful a countenance,
that there is not a hermit
so holy but he would have
forgotten his beads for love
of her. • But when the
gentleman recognized her
with both eye and ear, and
found he was not with her
for whose sake he had so
greatly suffered, the love
that had made him get so
quickly into the bed, made
him rise from it still more
quickly. And in anger
equally with mistress and
damsel, he said— "Neither
your folly nor the malice of
her who put you there can
make me other than I am.
But do you try to be an
honest woman, for you
shall never lose that good
name through me. " • So
saying he rushed out of the
room in the greatest wrath
imaginable, and it was long
before he returned to see his
mistress. However love,
which is never without
hope, assured him that the
greater and more manifest
his constancy was proved to
be by all these trials, the
longer and more delightful
would be his bliss. • The
lady, who had seen and
heard all that passed, was
so delighted and amazed at
beholding the depth and
constancy of his love, that
she was impatient to sec

soon as she could meet

forgot all his troubles but
even deemed them very

had disgraced knighthood by riding in the cart. But no one could stop him
or slow him down, and finally he discovered that the queen's kidnapper was
the wicked Meleagant. He caught up with Meleagant and the two fought a
duel. Still weak from the chase, Lancelot seemed to be near defeat, but
when word reached him that the queen was watching the battle, he recovered his strength and was on the verge of killing Meleagant when a truce
was called. Guinevere was handed over to him.
Lancelot could hardly contain his joy at the thought of finally being in
his lady's presence. But to his shock, she seemed angry, and would not look
at her rescuer. She told Meleagant's father, "Sire, in truth he has wasted his
efforts. I shall always deny that I feel any gratitude toward him." Lancelot
was mortified but he did not complain. Much later, after undergoing innumerable further trials, she finally relented and they became lovers. One day
he asked her: when she had been abducted by Meleagant, had she heard the
story of the cart, and how he had disgraced knighthood? Was that why she
had treated him so coldly that day? The queen replied, "By delaying for
two steps you showed your unwillingness to climb into it. That, to tell the
truth, is why I didn't wish to see you or speak with you."

Interpretation. The opportunity to do your selfless deed often comes upon
you suddenly. You have to show your worth in an instant, right there on
the spot. It could be a rescue situation, a gift you could make or a favor you
could do, a sudden request to drop everything and come to their aid. What
matters most is not whether you act rashly, make a mistake, and do something foolish, but that you seem to act on their behalf without thought for
yourself or the consequences.
At moments like these, hesitation, even for a few seconds, can ruin all
the hard work of your seduction, revealing you as self-absorbed, unchivalrous, and cowardly. This, at any rate, is the moral of Chrétien de Troyes's
twelfth-century version of the story of Lancelot. Remember: not only
what you do matters, but how you do it. If you are naturally self-absorbed,
learn to disguise it. React as spontaneously as possible, exaggerating the effect by seeming flustered, overexcited, even foolish—love has driven you to
that point. If you have to jump into the cart for Guinevere's sake, make sure
she sees that you do it without the slightest hesitation.

5. In Rome sometime around 1531, word spread of a sensational young
woman named Tullia d'Aragona. By the standards of the period, Tullia was
not a classic beauty; she was tall and thin, at a time when the plump and
voluptuous woman was considered the ideal. And she lacked the cloying,
giggling manner of most young girls who wanted masculine attention. No,
her quality was nobler. Her Latin was perfect, she could discuss the latest
literature, she played the lute and sang. In other words, she was a novelty,

Interpretation. All of us have defects of some sort. Some of these we are

and the sincerity of his sentiments. He could be sent on a quest, or made
to live among lepers, or compete in a possibly fatal joust for her honor.
And this he had to do without complaint. Although the days of the troubadour are long gone, the pattern remains: a man actually loves to be able to
prove himself, to be challenged, to compete, to undergo tests and trials and
emerge victorious. He has a masochistic streak; a part of him loves pain.
And strangely enough, the more a woman asks for, the worthier she seems.
A woman who is easy to get cannot be worth much.
Make people compete for your attention, make them prove themselves
in some way, and you will find them rising to the challenge. The heat of
seduction is raised by such challenges—show me that you really love me.
When one person (of either sex) rises to the occasion, often the other person is now expected to do the same, and the seduction heightens. By making people prove themselves, too, you raise your value and cover up your
defects. Your targets are too busy trying to prove themselves to notice your
blemishes and faults.
Symbol:

The

Tour-

nament. On the field, with its bright pennants
and caparisoned horses, the lady looks on as knights fight for
her hand. She has heard them declare love on bended knee, their
endless songs and pretty promises. They are all good at such things.
But then the trumpet sounds and the combat begins. In the tournament there can be no faking or hesitation. The knight she
chooses must have blood on his face, and a few
broken limbs.

Reversal
hen trying to prove that you are worthy of your target, remember
that every target sees things differently. A show of physical prowess
will not impress someone who does not value physical prowess; it will just
show that you are after attention, flaunting yourself. Seducers must adapt
their way of proving themselves to the doubts and weaknesses of the seduced. For some, fine words are better proofs than daredevil deeds, particularly if they are written down. With these people show your sentiments in
a letter—a different kind of physical proof, and one with more poetic appeal than some showy bit of action. Know your target well, and aim your
seductive evidence at the source of their doubts or resistance.

W

Effect a Regression

People who
have experienced a certain kind of
pleasure in the past will try to repeat or relive
it. The deepest-rooted and most pleasurable memories
are usually those from earliest childhood, and are often unconsciously associated with a parental figure. Bring your targets back to that point by placing yourself in the oedipal triangle
and positioning them as the needy child. Unaware of the cause of
their emotional response, they will fall in love with you. Alternatively, you too can regress, letting them play the role of the protecting, nursing parent. In either case you are offering the
ultimate fantasy: the chance to have an intimate relationship with mommy or daddy, son or daughter.

tion. The method has infinite applications outside psychoanalysis. To practice it in real life, you need to play the therapist, encouraging people to talk
about their childhood. Most of us are only too happy to oblige; and our
memories are so vivid and emotional that a part of us regresses just in talking about our early years. Also, in the course of talking, little secrets slip
out: we reveal all kinds of valuable information about our weaknesses and
our mental makeup, information you must attend to and remember. Do
not take your targets' words at face value; they will often sugarcoat or overdramatize events in childhood. But pay attention to their tone of voice, to
any nervous tics as they talk, and particularly to anything they do not want
to talk about, anything they deny or that makes them emotional. Many statements actually mean their opposite: should they say they hated their father,
for instance, you can be sure that they are hiding a lot of disappointment—
that they actually loved their father only too much, and perhaps never quite
got what they wanted from him. Listen closely for recurring themes and
stories. Most important, learn to analyze emotional responses and see what
lies behind them.
While they talk, maintain the therapist's pose—attentive but quiet,

The Infantile Regression. The first bond—the bond between a mother
and her infant—is the most powerful one. Unlike other animals, human babies have a long period of helplessness during which they are dependent on
their mother, creating an attachment that influences the rest of their lives.
The key to effecting this regression is to reproduce the sense of unconditional love a mother has for her child. Never judge your targets—let them
do whatever they want, including behaving badly; at the same time surround them with loving attention, smother them with comfort. A part of

them will regress to those earliest years when their mother took care of
everything and rarely left them alone. This works on almost everyone, for
unconditional love is the rarest and most treasured form. You do not even
have to tailor your behavior to anything specific in their childhood; most of
us have experienced this kind of attention. Meanwhile, create atmospheres
that reinforce the feeling you are generating—warm environments, playful
activities, bright, happy colors.

The Oedipal Regression. After the bond between mother and child
comes the oedipal triangle of mother, father, and child. This triangle forms
during the period of the child's earliest erotic fantasies. A boy wants his
mother to himself, a girl does the same with her father, but they never
quite have it that way, for a parent will always have competing connections
to a spouse or to other adults. Unconditional love has gone; now, inevitably, the parent must sometimes deny what the child desires. Transport your
victims back to this period. Play a parental role, be loving, but also sometimes scold and instill some discipline. Children actually love a little
discipline—it makes them feel that the adult cares about them. And adult
children too will be thrilled if you mix your tenderness with a little toughness and punishment.
Unlike infantile regression, oedipal regression must be tailored to your
target. It depends on the information you have gathered. Without knowing
enough, you might treat a person like a child, scolding them now and then,
only to discover that you are stirring up ugly memories—they had too
much discipline as child. Or you might stir up memories of a parent they
loathed, and they will transfer those feelings to you. Do not go ahead
with the regression until you have learned everything you can about their
childhood—what they had too much of, what they lacked, and so on. If
the target was strongly attached to a parent, but that attachment was partially negative, the oedipal regression strategy can still be quite effective. We
always feel ambivalent toward a parent; even as we love them, we resent
having had to depend on them. Don't worry about stirring up these ambivalences, which don't keep us from being tied to our parents. Remember
to include an erotic component in your parental behavior. Now your targets are not only getting their mother or father all to themselves, they are
getting something more, something previously forbidden but now allowed.

The Ego Ideal Regression. As children, we often form an ideal figure out
of our dreams and ambitions. First, that ideal figure is the person we want
to be. We imagine ourselves as brave adventurers, romantic figures. Then,
in our adolescence, we turn our attention to others, often projecting our
ideals onto them. The first boy or girl we fall in love with may seem to
have the ideal qualities we wanted for ourselves, or else may make us feel
that we can play that ideal role in relation to them. Most of us carry these

ideals around with us, buried just below the surface. We are secretly disappointed in how much we have had to compromise, how far below the ideal
we have fallen as we have gotten older. Make your targets feel they are living out this youthful ideal, and coming closer to being the person they
wanted to be, and you will effect a different kind of regression, creating
a feeling reminiscent of adolescence. The relationship between you and
the seduced is in this instance more equal than in the previous kinds of
regressions—more like the affection between siblings. In fact the ideal is
often modeled on a brother or sister. To create this effect, strive to reproduce the intense, innocent mood of a youthful infatuation.

The Reverse Parental Regression. Here you are the one to regress: you
deliberately play the role of the cute, adorable, yet also sexually charged
child. Older people always find younger people incredibly seductive. In the
presence of youth, they feel a little of their own youth return; but they are
in fact older, and mixed into the invigoration they feel in young people's
company is the pleasure of playing the mother or father to them. If a child
has erotic feelings toward a parent, feelings that are quickly repressed, the
parent must deal with the same problem in reverse. Assume the role of the
child in relation to your targets, however, and they get to act out some of
those repressed erotic sentiments. The strategy may seem to call for a difference in age, but this is actually not critical. Marilyn Monroe's exaggerated
little-girl qualities worked just fine on men her age. Emphasizing a weakness or vulnerability on your part will give the target a chance to play the
protector.

Some Examples
1. The parents of Victor Hugo separated shortly after the novelist was
born, in 1802. Hugo's mother, Sophie, had been carrying on an affair with
her husband's superior officer, a general. She took the three Hugo boys
away from their father and went off to Paris to raise them on her own.
Now the boys led a tumultuous life, featuring bouts of poverty, frequent
moves, and their mother's continued affair with the general. Of all the
boys, Victor was the most attached to his mother, adopting all her ideas and
pet peeves, particularly her hatred of his father. But with all the turmoil in
his childhood he never felt he got enough love and attention from the
mother he adored. When she died, in 1821, poor and debt-ridden, he was
devastated.
The following year Hugo married his childhood sweetheart, Adèle,
who physically resembled his mother. It was a happy marriage for a while,
but soon Adèle came to resemble his mother in more ways than one: in
1832, he discovered that she was having an affair with the French literary
critic Sainte-Beuve, who also happened to be Hugo's best friend at the

Effect a Regression •

time. Hugo was a celebrated writer by now, but he was not the calculating
type. He generally wore his heart on his sleeve. Yet he could not confide in
anyone about Adèle's affair; it was too humiliating. His only solution was to
have affairs of his own, with actresses, courtesans, married women. Hugo
had a prodigious appetite, sometimes visiting three different women in the
same day.
Near the end of 1832, production began on one of Hugo's plays, and
he was to supervise the casting. A twenty-six-year-old actress named Juliette Drouet auditioned for one of the smaller roles. Normally quite adroit
with the ladies, Hugo found himself stuttering in Juliette's presence. She
was quite simply the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and this and
her composed manner intimidated him. Naturally, Juliette won the part.
He found himself thinking about her all the time. She always seemed to be
surrounded by a group of adoring men. Clearly she was not interested in
him, or so he thought. One evening, though, after a performance of the play,
he followed her home, to find that she was neither angry nor surprised—
indeed she invited him up to her apartment. He spent the night, and soon
he was spending almost every night there.
Hugo was happy again. To his delight, Juliette quit her career in the
theater, dropped her former friends, and learned to cook. She had loved
fancy clothes and social affairs; now she became Hugo's secretary, rarely
leaving the apartment in which he had established her and seeming to live
only for his visits. After a while, however, Hugo returned to his old ways
and started to have little affairs on the side. She did not complain—as long
as she remained the one woman he kept returning to. And Hugo had in
fact grown quite dependent on her.
In 1843, Hugo's beloved daughter died in an accident and he sank into
a depression. The only way he knew to get over his grief was to have an affair with someone new. And so, shortly thereafter, he fell in love with a
young married aristocrat named Léonie d'Aunet. He began to see Juliette
less and less. A few years later, Léonie, feeling certain she was the preferred
one, gave him an ultimatum: stop seeing Juliette altogether, or it was over.
Hugo refused. Instead he decided to stage a contest: he would continue to
see both women, and in a few months his heart would tell him which one
he preferred. Léonie was furious, but she had no choice. Her affair with
Hugo had already ruined her marriage and her standing in society; she was
dependent on him. Anyway, how could she lose—she was in the prime of
life, whereas Juliette had gray hair by now. So she pretended to go along
with this contest, but as time went on, she grew increasingly resentful about
it, and complained. Juliette, on the other hand, behaved as if nothing had
changed. Whenever he visited, she treated him as she always had, dropping
everything to comfort and mother him.
The contest lasted several years. In 1851, Hugo was in trouble with
Louis-Napoleon, the cousin of Napoleon Bonaparte and now the president
of France. Hugo had attacked his dictatorial tendencies in the press, bitterly
and perhaps recklessly, for Louis-Napoleon was a vengeful man. Fearing for

the writer's life, Juliette managed to hide him in a friend's house and
arranged for a false passport, a disguise, and safe passage to Brussels. Everything went according to plan; Juliette joined him a few days later, carrying
his most valuable possessions. Clearly her heroic actions had won the contest for her.
And yet, after the novelty of Hugo's new life wore off, his affairs resumed. Finally, fearing for his health, and worried that she could no longer
compete with yet another twenty-year-old coquette, Juliette made a calm
but stern demand: no more women or she was leaving him. Taken completely by surprise, yet certain that she meant every word, Hugo broke
down and sobbed. An old man by now, he got down on his knees and
swore, on the Bible and then on a copy of his famous novel Les Misérables,
that he would stray no more. Until Juliette's death, in 1883, her spell over
him was complete.

Interpretation. Hugo's love life was determined by his relationship with his
mother. He never felt she had loved him enough. Almost all the women he
had affairs with bore a physical resemblance to her; somehow he would
make up for her lack of love for him by sheer volume. When Juliette met
him, she could not have known all this, but she must have sensed two
things: he was extremely disappointed in his wife, and he had never really
grown up. His emotional outbursts and his need for attention made him
more a little boy than a man. She would gain ascendancy over him for the
rest of his life by supplying the one thing he had never had: complete, unconditional mother-love.
Juliette never judged Hugo, or criticized him for his naughty ways. She
lavished him with attention; visiting her was like returning to the womb. In
her presence, in fact, he was more a little boy than ever. How could he
refuse her a favor or ever leave her? And when she finally threatened to
leave him, he was reduced to the state of a wailing infant crying for his
mother. In the end she had total power over him.
Unconditional love is rare and hard to find, yet it is what we all crave,
since we either experienced it once or wish we had. You do not have to go
as far as Juliette Drouet; the mere hint of devoted attention, of accepting
your lovers for who they are, of meeting their needs, will place them in an
infantile position. A sense of dependency may frighten them a little, and
they may feel an undercurrent of ambivalence, a need to assert themselves
periodically, as Hugo did through his affairs. But their ties to you will be
strong and they will keep coming back for more, bound by the illusion that
they are recapturing the mother-love they had seemingly lost forever, or
never had.

2. Around the turn of the twentieth century, Professor Mut, a schoolmaster at a college for young men in a small German town, began to de-

Effect a Regression

velop a keen hatred of his students. Mut was in his late fifties, and had
worked at the same school for many years. He taught Greek and Latin and
was a distinguished classical scholar. He had always felt a need to impose
discipline, but now it was getting ugly: the students were simply not interested in Homer anymore. They listened to bad music and only liked modern literature. Although they were rebellious, Mut considered them soft
and undisciplined. He wanted to teach them a lesson and make their lives
miserable; his usual way of dealing with their bouts of rowdiness was sheer
bullying, and most often it worked.
One day a student Mut loathed—a haughty, well-dressed young man
named Lohmann—stood up in class and said, "I can't go on working in this
room, Professor. There is such a smell of mud." Mud was the boys' nickname for Professor Mut. The professor seized Lohmann by the arm,
twisted it hard, then banished him from the room. He later noticed that
Lohmann had left his exercise book behind, and thumbing through it he
saw a paragraph about an actress named Rosa Fröhlich. A plot hatched in
Mut's mind: he would catch Lohmann cavorting with this actress, no doubt
a woman of ill repute, and would get the boy kicked out of school.
First he had to find out where she performed. He searched high and
low, finally finding her name up outside a club called the Blue Angel.
He went in. It was a smoke-filled place, full of the working-class types
he looked down on. Rosa was onstage. She was singing a song; the way she
looked everyone in the audience in the eye was rather brazen, but for some
reason Mut found this disarming. He relaxed a little, had some wine. After
her performance he made his way to her dressing room, determined to grill
her about Lohmann. Once there he felt strangely uncomfortable, but he
gathered up his courage, accused her of leading schoolboys astray, and
threatened to get the police to close the place down. Rosa, however, was
not intimidated. She turned all of Mut's sentences around: perhaps he was
the one leading boys astray. Her tone was cajoling and teasing. Yes,
Lohmann had bought her flowers and champagne—so what? No one had
ever talked to Mut this way before; his authoritative tone usually made people give way. He should have felt offended: she was low class and a woman,
and he was a schoolmaster, but she was talking to him as if they were
equals. Instead, however, he neither got angry nor left—something compelled him to stay.
Now she was silent. She picked up a stocking and started to darn it, ignoring him; his eyes followed her every move, particularly the way she
rubbed her bare knee. Finally he brought up Lohmann again, and the police. "You've no idea what this life's like," she said. "Everyone who comes
here thinks he's the only pebble on the beach. If you don't give them what
they want they threaten you with the police!" "I certainly regret having
hurt a lady's feelings," he replied sheepishly. As she got up from her chair,
their knees rubbed, and he felt a shiver up his spine. Now she was nice to
him again, and poured him some more wine. She invited him to come
back, then left abruptly to perform another number.

The next day he kept thinking about her words, her looks. Thinking
about her while he was teaching gave him a kind of naughty thrill. That
night he went back to the club, still determined to catch Lohmann in the
act, and once again found himself in Rosa's dressing room, drinking wine
and becoming strangely passive. She asked him to help her get dressed; that
seemed quite an honor and he obliged her. Helping her with her corset and
her makeup, he forgot about Lohmann. He felt he was being initiated into
some new world. She pinched his cheeks and stroked his chin, and occasionally let him glimpse her bare leg as she rolled up a stocking.
Now Professor Mut showed up night after night, helping her dress,
watching her perform, all with a strange kind of pride. He was there so
often that Lohmann and his friends no longer showed up. He had taken
their place—he was the one to bring her flowers, pay for her champagne,
the one to serve her. Yes, an old man like himself had bested the youthful
Lohmann, who thought himself so suave! He liked it when she stroked his
chin, complimented him for doing things right, but he felt even more excited when she rebuked him, throwing a powder puff in his face or pushing
him off a chair. It meant she liked him. And so, gradually, he began to pay
for all her caprices. It cost him a pretty penny but kept her away from other
men. Eventually he proposed to her. They married, and scandal ensued: he
lost his job, and soon all his money; finally he landed in prison. To the very
end, however, he could never get angry with Rosa. Instead he felt guilty:
he had never done enough for her.

Interpretation. Professor Mut and Rosa Fröhlich are characters in the
novel The Blue Angel, written by Heinrich Mann in 1905, and later made
into a film starring Marlene Dietrich. Rosa's seduction of Mut follows the
classic oedipal regression pattern. First, the woman treats the man the way a
mother would treat a little boy. She scolds him, but the scolding is not
threatening; it is tender, and has a teasing edge. Like a mother, she knows
she is dealing with someone weak, who cannot help his naughty behavior.
She mixes plenty of praise and approval in with her taunts. Once the man
begins to regress, she adds physical excitement—some bodily contact to excite him, subtle sexual overtones. As a reward for his regression, the man may
get the thrill of finally sleeping with his mother. But there is always an element of competition, which the mother figure must heighten. The man
gets to possess her all on his own, something he could not do with father in
the way, but he first has to win her away from others.
The key to this kind of regression is to see and treat your targets as children. Nothing about them intimidates you, no matter how much authority
or social standing they have. Your manner makes it clear that you feel you
are the stronger party. To accomplish this it may be helpful to imagine or
visualize them as the children they once were; suddenly, powerful people
do not seem so powerful and threatening when you regress them in your
imagination. Keep in mind that certain types are more vulnerable to an

Effect a Regression •

oedipal regression. Look for those who, like Professor Mut, seem outwardly
the most adult—straitlaced, serious, a little full of themselves. They are
struggling to repress their regressive tendencies, overcompensating for their
weaknesses. Often those who seem the most in command of themselves are
the ripest for regression. In fact they are secretly longing for it, because their
power, position, and responsibilities are more a burden than a pleasure.

3. Born in 1768, the French writer François René de Chateaubriand grew
up in a medieval castle in Brittany. The castle was cold and gloomy, as if inhabited by the ghosts of its past. The family lived there in semiseclusion.
Chateaubriand spent much of his time with his sister Lucile, and his attachment to her was strong enough that rumors of incest made the rounds. But
when he was around fifteen, a new woman named Sylphide entered his
life—a woman he created in his imagination, a composite of all the heroines, goddesses, and courtesans he had read about in books. He was constantly seeing her features in his mind, and hearing her voice. Soon she was
taking walks with him, carrying on conversations. He imagined her innocent and exalted, yet they would sometimes do things that were not so innocent. He carried on this relationship for two whole years, until finally he
left for Paris, and replaced Sylphide with women of flesh and blood.
The French public, weary after the terrors of the 1790s, greeted
Chateaubriand's first books enthusiastically, sensing a new spirit in them.
His novels were full of windswept castles, brooding heroes, and passionate
heroines. Romanticism was in the air. Chateaubriand himself resembled
the characters in his novels, and despite his rather unattractive appearance,
women went wild over him—with him, they could escape their boring
marriages and live out the kind of turbulent romance he wrote about.
Chateaubriand's nickname was the Enchanter, and although he was married, and an ardent Catholic, the number of his affairs increased with the
years. But he had a restless nature—he traveled to the Middle East, to the
United States, all over Europe. He could not find what he was looking for
anywhere, and not the right woman either: after the novelty of an affair
wore off, he would leave. By 1807 he had had so many affairs, and still felt
so unsatisfied, that he decided to retire to his country estate, called Vallée
aux Loups. He filled the place with trees from all over the world, transforming the grounds into something out of one of his novels. There he
began to write the memoirs that he envisioned would be his masterpiece.
By 1817, however, Chateaubriand's life had fallen apart. Money problems had forced him to sell Vallée aux Loups. Almost fifty, he suddenly felt
old, his inspiration dried up. That year he visited the writer Madame de
Staël, who had been ill and was now close to death. He spent several days at
her bedside, along with her closest friend, Juliette Récamier. Madame Récamier's affairs were infamous. She was married to a much older man, but
they had not lived together for some time; she had broken the hearts of the
most illustrious men in Europe, including Prince Metternich, the Duke of

The Art of Seduction

Wellington, and the writer Benjamin Constant. It had also been rumored
that despite all her flirtations she was still a virgin. She was now almost
forty, but she was the type of woman who seems youthful at any age.
Drawn together by their grief over de Staël's death, she and Chateaubriand
became friends. She listened so attentively to him, adopting his moods and
echoing his sentiments, that he felt that he had at last met a woman who
understood him. There was also something rather ethereal about Madame
Récamier. Her walk, her voice, her eyes—more than one man had compared her to some unearthly angel. Chateaubriand soon burned with the
desire to possess her physically.
The year after their friendship began, she had a surprise for him: she
had convinced a friend to purchase Vallée aux Loups. The friend was away
for a few weeks, and she invited Chateaubriand to spend some time with
her at his former estate. He happily accepted. He showed her around, explaining what each little patch of ground had meant to him, the memories
the place conjured up. He felt youthful feelings welling up inside him, feelings he had forgotten about. He delved further into the past, describing
events in his childhood. At moments, walking with Madame Récamier and
looking into those kind eyes, he felt a shiver of recognition, but he could
not quite identify it. All he knew was that he had to go back to the memoirs that he had laid aside. "I intend to employ the little time that is left to
me in describing my youth," he said, "so long as its essence remains palpable to me."
It seemed that Madame Récamier returned Chateaubriand's love, but as
usual she struggled to keep it a spiritual affair. The Enchanter, however,
deserved his nickname. His poetry, his air of melancholy, and his persistence finally won the day and she succumbed, perhaps for the first time in
her life. Now, as lovers, they were inseparable. But as always with Chateaubriand, over time one woman was not enough. The restless spirit
returned. He began to have affairs again. Soon he and Récamier stopped
seeing each other.
In 1832, Chateaubriand was traveling through Switzerland. Once again
his life had taken a downward turn; only this time he truly was old, in body
and spirit. In the Alps, strange thoughts of his youth began to assail him,
memories of the castle in Brittany. Word reached him that Madame Récamier was in the area. He had not seen her in years, and he hurried to the
inn where she was staying. She was as kind to him as ever; during the day
they took walks together, and at night they stayed up late, talking.
One day, Chateaubriand told Récamier he had finally decided to finish
his memoirs. And he had a confession to make: he told her the story of
Sylphide, his imaginary lover when he was growing up. He had once
hoped to meet a Sylphide in real life, but the women he had known had
paled in comparison. Over the years he had forgotten about his imaginary
lover, but now he was an old man, and he not only thought of her again,
he could see her face and hear her voice. And with those memories he realized that he had in fact met Sylphide in real life—it was Madame Ré-

camier. The face and voice were close. More important, there was the calm
spirit, the innocent, virginal quality. Reading to her the prayer to Sylphide
he had just written, he told her he wanted to be young again, and seeing
her had brought his youth back to him. Reconciled with Madame Récamier, he began to work again on the memoirs, which were eventually
published under the title Memoirs from Beyond the Grave. Most critics agreed
that the book was his masterpiece. The memoirs were dedicated to
Madame Récamier, to whom he remained devoted until his death, in
1848.

Interpretation. All of us carry within us an image of an ideal type of person whom we yearn to meet and love. Most often the type is a composite
made up of bits and pieces of different people from our youth, and even of
characters in books and movies. People who influenced us inordinately—a
teacher for instance—may also figure. The traits have nothing to do with
superficial interests. Rather, they are unconscious, hard to verbalize.
We searched hardest for this ideal type in our adolescence, when we
were more idealistic. Often our first loves have more of these traits than our
subsequent affairs. For Chateaubriand, living with his family in their secluded castle, his first love was his sister Lucile, whom he adored and idealized. But since love with her was impossible, he created a figure out of his
imagination who had all her positive attributes—nobility of spirit, innocence, courage.
Madame Récamier could not have known about Chateaubriand's ideal
type, but she did know something about him, well before she ever met
him. She had read all of his books, and his characters were highly autobiographical. She knew of his obsession with his lost youth; and everyone
knew of his endless and unsatisfying affairs with women, his hyperrestless
spirit. Madame Récamier knew how to mirror people, entering their spirit,
and one of her first acts was to take Chateaubriand to Vallée aux Loups,
where he felt he had left part of his youth. Alive with memories, he regressed further into his childhood, to the days in the castle. She actively encouraged this. Most important, she embodied a spirit that came naturally to
her, but that matched his youthful ideal: innocent, noble, kind. (The fact
that so many men fell in love with her suggests that many men had the
same ideals.) Madame Récamier was Lucile/Sylphide. It took him years to
realize it, but when he did, her spell over him was complete.
It is nearly impossible to embody someone's ideal completely. But if
you come close enough, if you evoke some of that ideal spirit, you can lead
that person into a deep seduction. To effect this regression you must play
the role of the therapist. Get your targets to open up about their past, particularly their former loves and most particularly their first love. Pay attention to any expressions of disappointment, how this or that person did not
give them what they wanted. Take them to places that evoke their youth.
In this regression you are creating not so much a relationship of depen-

345

346

•

The Art of Seduction

dency and immaturity but rather the adolescent spirit of a first love. There
is a touch of innocence to the relationship. So much of adult life involves
compromise, conniving, and a certain toughness. Create the ideal atmosphere by keeping such things out, drawing the other person into a kind of
mutual weakness, conjuring a second virginity. There should be a dreamlike quality to the affair, as if the target were reliving that first love but
could not quite believe it. Let all of this unfold slowly, each encounter revealing more ideal qualities. The sense of reliving a past pleasure is simply
impossible to resist.

4. Some time in the summer of 1614, several members of England's upper
nobility, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, met to decide what to
do about the Earl of Somerset, the favorite of King James I, who was
forty-eight at the time. After eight years as the favorite, the young earl had
accumulated such power and wealth, and so many titles, that nothing was
left for anyone else. But how to get rid of this powerful man? For the time
being the conspirators had no answer.
A few weeks later the king was inspecting the royal stables when he
caught sight of a young man who was new to the court: the twenty-twoyear-old George Villiers, a member of the lower nobility. The courtiers
who accompanied the king that day watched the king's eyes following Villiers, and saw with what interest he asked about this young man. Indeed
everyone had to agree that he was a most handsome youth, with the face of
an angel and a charmingly childish manner. When news of the king's interest in Villiers reached the conspirators, they instantly knew they had found
what they had been looking for: a young man who could seduce the king
and supplant the dreaded favorite. Left to nature, though, the seduction
would never happen. They had to help it along. So, without telling Villiers
of their plan, they befriended him.
King James was the son of Mary Queen of Scots. His childhood had
been a nightmare: his father, his mother's favorite, and his own regents had
all been murdered; his mother had first been exiled, later executed. When
James was young, to escape suspicion he played the part of a fool. He hated
the sight of a sword and could not stand the slightest sign of argument.
When his cousin Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603, leaving no heir, he became king of England.
James surrounded himself with bright, happy young men, and seemed
to prefer the company of boys. In 1612, his son, Prince Henry, died. The
king was inconsolable. He needed distraction and good cheer, and his favorite, the Earl of Somerset, was no longer so young and attractive. The
timing for a seduction was perfect. And so the conspirators went to work
on Villiers, under the guise of trying to help him advance within the court.
They supplied him with a magnificent wardrobe, jewels, a glittering carriage, the kind of things the king noticed. They worked on his riding,

fencing, tennis, dancing, his skills with birds and dogs. He was instructed in
the art of conversation—how to flatter, tell a joke, sigh at the right moment. Fortunately Villiers was easy to work with; he had a naturally buoyant manner and nothing seemed to bother him. That same year the
conspirators managed to get him appointed the royal cup-bearer: every
night he poured out the king's wine, so that the king could see him up
close. After a few weeks, the king was in love. The boy seemed to crave attention and tenderness, exactly what he yearned to offer. How wonderful it
would be to mold and educate him. And what a perfect figure he had!
The conspirators convinced Villiers to break off his engagement to a
young lady; the king was single-minded in his affections, and could not
stand competition. Soon James wanted to be around Villiers all the time,
for he had the qualities the king admired: innocence and a lighthearted
spirit. The king appointed Villiers gentleman of the bedchamber, making it
possible for them to be alone together. What particularly charmed James
was that Villiers never asked for anything, which made it all the more delightful to spoil him.
By 1616, Villiers had completely supplanted the former favorite. He
was now the Earl of Buckingham, and a member of the king's privy council. To the conspirators' dismay, however, he quickly accumulated even
more privileges than the Earl of Somerset had done. The king would call
him sweetheart in public, fix his doublets, comb his hair. James zealously
protected his favorite, anxious to preserve the young man's innocence. He
tended to the youth's every whim, in effect became his slave. In fact the
king seemed to regress; whenever Steenie, his nickname for Villiers, entered the room, he started to act like a child. The two were inseparable until the king's death, in 1625.

Interpretation. We are most definitely stamped forever by our parents, in
ways we can never fully understand. But the parents are equally influenced
and seduced by the child. They may play the role of the protector, but in
the process they absorb the child's spirit and energy, relive a part of their
own childhood. And just as the child struggles against sexual feelings
toward the parent, the parent must repress comparable erotic feelings that
lie just beneath the tenderness they feel. The best and most insidious way to
seduce people is often to position yourself as the child. Imagining themselves stronger, more in control, they will be lured into your web. They will
feel they have nothing to fear. Emphasize your immaturity, your weakness,
and you let them indulge in fantasies of protecting and parenting you—a
strong desire as people get older. What they do not realize is that you are
getting under their skin, insinuating yourself—it is the child who is controlling the adult. Your innocence makes them want to protect you, but it is
also sexually charged. Innocence is highly seductive; some people even long
to play the corrupter of innocence. Stir up their latent sexual feelings and

you can lead them astray with the hope of fulfilling a strong yet repressed
fantasy: sleeping with the child figure. In your presence, too, they will begin to regress as well, infected by your childish, playful spirit.
Most of this came naturally to Villiers, but you will probably have to
use some calculation. Fortunately, all of us have strong childish tendencies
within us that are easy to access and exaggerate. Make your gestures seem
spontaneous and unplanned. Any sexual element of your behavior should
seem innocent, unconscious. Like Villiers, don't push for favors. Parents
prefer to spoil children who don't ask for things but invite them in their
manner. Seeming nonjudgmental and uncritical of those around you will
make everything you do seem more natural and naive. Have a happy, cheerful demeanor, but with a playful edge. Emphasize any weaknesses you
might have, things you cannot control. Remember: most of us remember
our early years fondly, but often, paradoxically, the people with the strongest attachment to those times are the ones who had the most difficult
childhoods. Actually, circumstances kept them from getting to be children,
so they never really grew up, and they long for the paradise they never got
to experience. James I falls into this category. These types are ripe targets
for a reverse regression.

Symbol: The Bed. Lying alone in bed, the child
feels unprotected, afraid, and needy. In a nearby room, there is the parent's bed. It is large and
forbidding, site of things you are not supposed to know about. Give the seduced both feelings—helplessness and transgression—as you lay them into bed and put them to sleep.

Reversal

T

o reverse the strategies of regression, the parties to a seduction would
have to remain adults during the process. This is not only rare, it is not
very pleasurable. Seduction means realizing certain fantasies. Being a mature and responsible adult is not a fantasy, it is a duty. Furthermore, a person
who remains an adult in relation to you is harder to seduce. In all kinds of
seduction—political, media, personal—the target must regress. The only
danger is that the child, wearying of dependence, turns against the parent
and rebels. You must be prepared for this, and unlike a parent, never take it
personally.

Stir Up the Transgressive and Taboo

There are always social limits on what one can do.
Some of these, the most elemental taboos, go back centuries;
others are more superficial, simply defining polite and acceptable behavior. Making your targets feel that you are leading them
past either kind of limit is immensely seductive. People yearn to explore their dark side. Not everything in romantic love is supposed to
be tender and soft; hint that you have a cruel, even sadistic streak.
You do not respect age differences, marriage vows, family ties. Once
the desire to transgress draws your targets to you, it will be hard for
them to stop. Take them further than they imagined—the shared
feeling of guilt and complicity will create a powerful bond.

The Lost Self

I

n March of 1812, the twenty-four-year-old George Gordon Byron published the first cantos of his poem Childe Harold. The poem was filled
with familiar gothic imagery—a dilapidated abbey, debauchery, travels to
the mysterious East—but what made it different was that the hero of the
poem was also its villain: Harold was a man who led a life of vice, disdaining society's conventions yet somehow going unpunished. Also, the poem

heels, as it seemed he disdained everything, including his success. Soon he
was visiting Lady Caroline daily. He lingered in her boudoir, played with
her children, helped her choose her dress for the day. She pressed him to
talk of his life: he described his brutal father, the untimely deaths that
seemed to be a family curse, the crumbling abbey he had inherited, his adventures in Turkey and Greece. His life was indeed as gothic as that of
Childe Harold.
Within days the two became lovers. Now, though, the tables turned:
Lady Caroline pursued Byron with unladylike aggression. She dressed as a
page and sneaked into his carriage, wrote him extravagantly emotional letters, flaunted the affair. At last, a chance to play the grand romantic role of
her girlhood fantasies. Byron began to turn against her. He already loved to
shock; now he confessed to her the nature of the secret sin he had alluded
to in Childe Harold—his homosexual affairs during his travels. He made
cruel remarks, grew indifferent. But this only seemed to push her further.
She sent him the customary lock of hair, but from her pubis; she followed
him in the street, made public scenes—finally her family sent her abroad to
avoid further scandal. After Byron made it clear the affair was over, she descended into a madness that would last several years.
In 1813, an old friend of Byron's, James Webster, invited the poet to
stay
at his country estate. Webster had a young and beautiful wife, Lady

Interpretation. Women of Byron's time were longing to play a different
role than society allowed them. They were supposed to be the decent,
moralizing force in culture; only men had outlets for their darker impulses.
Underlying the social restrictions on women, perhaps, was a fear of the
more amoral and unbridled part of the female psyche.
Feeling repressed and restless, women of the time devoured gothic novels and romances, stories in which women were adventurous, and had the
same capacity for good and evil as men. Books like these helped to trigger a
revolt, with women like Lady Caroline playing out a little of the fantasy life

always limits. The alternative is anarchy, the lawlessness of nature, which we

posed, physically or psychologically, we are instantly curious. A part of us
wants to go beyond that limit, to explore what is forbidden.
If, as children, we are told not to go past a certain point in the woods,
that is precisely where we want to go. But we grow older, and become polite and deferential; more and more boundaries encumber our lives. Do not
confuse politeness with happiness, however. It covers up frustration, unwanted compromise. How can we explore the shadow side of our personality without incurring punishment or ostracism? It seeps out in our
dreams. We sometimes wake up with a sense of guilt at the murder, incest,
adultery, and mayhem that goes on in our dreams, until we realize no one
needs to know about it but ourselves. But give a person the sense that with
you they will have a chance to explore the outer reaches of acceptable, polite behavior, that with you they can vent some of their closeted personality, and you create the ingredients for a deep and powerful seduction.
You will have to go beyond the point of merely teasing them with an
elusive fantasy. The shock and seductive power will come from the reality
of what you are offering them. Like Byron, at a certain point you can even
press it further than they may want to go. If they have followed you merely
out of curiosity, they may feel some fear and hesitation, but once they are
hooked, they will fond you hard to resist, for it is hard to return to a limit
once you have transgressed and gone past it. The human cries out for more,
and does not know when to stop. You will determine for them when it is
time to stop.
The moment people feel that something is prohibited, a part of them
will want it. That is what makes a married man or woman such a delicious
target—the more someone is prohibited, the greater the desire. George Villiers, the Earl of Buckingham, was the favorite first of King James I, then of
James's son, King Charles I. Nothing was ever denied him. In 1625, on a
visit to France, he met the beautiful Queen Anne and fell hopelessly in
love. What could be more impossible, more out of reach, than the queen of
a rival power? He could have had almost any other woman, but the prohibited nature of the queen completely enflamed him, until he embarrassed
himself and his country by trying to kiss her in public.
Since what is forbidden is desired, somehow you must make yourself
seem forbidden. The most blatant way to do this is to engage in behavior
that gives you a dark and forbidden aura. Theoretically you are someone to
avoid; in fact you are too seductive to resist. That was the allure of the actor
Errol Flynn, who, like Byron, often found himself the pursued rather than
the pursuer. Flynn was devilishly handsome, but he also had something
else: a definite criminal streak. In his wild youth he engaged in all kinds of
shady activities. In the 1950s he was charged with rape, a permanent stain
on his reputation even though he was acquitted; but his popularity among
women only increased. Play up your dark side and you will have a similar
effect. For your targets to be involved with you means going beyond their
limits, doing something naughty and unacceptable—to society, to their
peers. For many that is reason to bite the bait.

The Art of Seduction

In Junichiro Tanazaki's 1928 novel Quicksand, Sonoko Kakiuchi, the
wife of a respectable lawyer, is bored and decides to take art classes to wile
away the time. There, she finds herself fascinated with a fellow female student, the beautiful Mitsuko, who befriends her, then seduces her. Kakiuchi
is forced to tell endless lies to her husband about her involvement with
Mitsuko and their frequent trysts. Mitsuko slowly involves her in all kinds
of nefarious activities, including a love triangle with a bizarre young man.
Each time Kakiuchi is made to explore some forbidden pleasure, Mitsuko
challenges her to go further and further. Kakiuchi hesitates, feels remorse—
she knows she is in the clutches of a devilish young seductress who has
played on her boredom to lead her astray. But in the end, she cannot help
following Mitsuko's lead—each transgressive act makes her want more.
Once your targets are drawn by the lure of the forbidden, dare them to
match you in transgressive behavior. Any kind of challenge is seductive.
Take it slowly heightening the challenge only after they show signs of
yielding to you. Once they are under your spell, they may not even notice
how far out on a limb you have taken them.
The great eighteenth-century rake Duc de Richelieu had a prediliction
for young girls and he would often heighten the seduction by enveloping
them in transgressive behavior, to which the young are particularly susceptible. For instance, he would find a way into the young girl's house and lure
her into her bed; the parents would be just down the hall, adding the
proper spice. Sometimes he would act as if they were about to be discovered, the momentary fright sharpening the overall thrill. In all cases, he
would try to turn the young girl against her parents, ridiculing their religious zeal or prudery or pious behavior. The duke's stategy was to attack
the values that his targets held dearest—precisely the values that represent a
limit. In a young person, family ties, religious ties, and the like are useful to
the seducer; young people barely need a reason to rebel against them. The
strategy, though, can be applied to a person of any age: for every deeply
held value there is a shadow side, a doubt, a desire to explore what those
values forbid.
In Renaissance Italy, a prostitute would dress as a lady and go to
church. Nothing was more exciting to a man than to exchange glances
with a woman whom he knew to be a whore as he was surrounded by his
wife, family, peers, and church officials. Every religion or value system
creates a dark side, the shadow realm of everything it prohibits. Tease your
targets, get them to flirt with whatever transgresses their family values,
which are often emotional yet superficial, since they are imposed from the
outside.
One of the most seductive men of the twentieth century, Rudolph
Valentino, was known as the Sex Menace. His appeal for women was
twofold: he could be tender and attentive, but he also hinted of cruelty. At
any moment he could become dangerously bold, perhaps even a little violent. The studios played up this double image as much as possible—when it
was reported that he had been abusive to his wife, for example, they ex-

Stir Up the Transgressive and Taboo

ploited the story. A mix of the masculine and the feminine, the violent and
the tender, will always seem transgressive and appealing. Love is supposed
to be tender and delicate, but in fact it can release violent and destructive
emotions; and the possible violence of love, the way it breaks down our
normal reasonableness, is just what attracts us. Approach romance's violent
side by mixing a cruel streak into your tender attentions, particularly in the
latter stages of the seduction, when the target is in your clutches. The
courtesan Lola Montez was known to turn to violence, using a whip now
and then, and Lou Andreas-Salomé could be exceptionally cruel to her
men, playing coquettish games, turning alternately icy and demanding. Her
cruelty only kept her targets coming back for more. A masochistic involvement can represent a great transgressive release.
The more illicit your seduction feels, the more powerful its effect. Give
your targets the feeling that they are committing a kind of crime, a deed
whose guilt they share with you. Create public moments in which the two
of you know something that those around you do not. It could be phrases
and looks that only you recognize, a secret. Byron's seductive appeal to
Lady Frances was connected to the nearness of her husband—in his company, for example, she had a love letter of Byron's hidden in her bosom. Johannes, the protagonist of Søren Kierkegaard's The Seducer's Diary, sent a
message to his target, the young Cordelia, in the middle of a dinner party
they were both attending; she could not reveal to the other guests that it
was from him, for then she would have to do some explaining. He might
also say something in public that would have a special meaning for her,
since it referred to something in one of his letters. All of this added spice to
the affair by giving it a feeling of a shared secret, even a guilty crime. It is
critical to play on tensions like these in public, creating a sense of complicity and collusion against the world.
In the Tristan and Isolde legend, the famous lovers reach the heights of
bliss and exhilaration exactly because of the taboos they break. Isolde is engaged to King Mark; she will soon be a married woman. Tristan is a loyal
subject and warrior in the service of King Mark, who is his father's age.
The whole affair has a feeling of stealing away the bride from the father.
Epitomizing the concept of love in the Western world, the legend has
had immense influence over the ages, and a crucial part of it is the idea
that without obstacles, without a feeling of transgression, love is weak and
flavorless.
People may be straining to remove restrictions on private behavior, to
make everything freer, in the world today, but that only makes seduction
more difficult and less exciting. Do what you can to reintroduce a feeling
of transgression and crime, even if it is only psychological or illusory.
There must be obstacles to overcome, social norms to flout, laws to break,
before the seduction can be consummated. It might seem that a permissive
society imposes few limits; find some. There will always be limits, sacred
cows, behavioral standards—endless ammunition for stirring up the transgressive and taboo.

Symbol: The Forest. The children are told not to go into the
forest that lies just beyond the safe confines of their home.
There is no law there, only wilderness, wild animals, and
criminals. But the chance to explore, the alluring darkness, and the fact that it is prohibited are impossible to resist. And once inside, they want
to go farther and farther.

Reversal

T

he reversal of stirring up taboos would be to stay within the limits
of acceptable behavior. That would make for a very tepid seduction. Which is not to say that only evil or wild behavior is seductive; goodness, kindness, and an aura of spirituality can be tremendously attractive,
since they are rare qualities. But notice that the game is the same. A person
who is kind or good or spiritual within the limits that society prescribes has
a weak appeal. It is those who go to the extreme—the Gandhis, the Krishnamurtis—who seduce us. They do not merely expound a spiritual lifestyle, they do away with all personal material comfort to live out their
ascetic ideals. They too go beyond the limits, transgressing acceptable behavior, because societies would find it hard to function if everyone went
to such lengths. In seduction, there is absolutely no power in respecting
boundaries and limits.

Use Spiritual Lures

Everyone has doubts and insecurities—about their body,
their self-worth, their sexuality. If
your seduction appeals exclusively to the
physical, you will stir up these doubts and
make your targets self-conscious. Instead, lure
them out of their insecurities by making them focus on something sublime and spiritual: a religious
experience, a lofty work of art, the occult. Play up
your divine qualities; affect an air of discontent with
worldly things; speak of the stars, destiny, the hidden
threads that unite you and the object of the seduction. Lost in a spiritual mist, the target will feel
light and uninhibited. Deepen the effect of
your seduction by making its sexual culmination seem like the spiritual
union of two souls.

androgynous, she was a novelty, and the wealthiest men in Europe vied
to possess her. By late in the decade, however, she had grown tired of it all.
"What a sterile life," she wrote a friend. "Always the same routine: the Bois,
the races, fittings; and to end an insipid day: dinner!" What wearied the
courtesan most was the constant attention of her male admirers, who

Interpretation. Liane de Pougy and Renée Vivien both suffered a similar
oppression: they were self-absorbed, hyperaware of themselves. The source
of this habit in Liane was men's constant attention to her body. She could
never escape their looks, which plagued her with a feeling of heaviness. Renée, meanwhile, thought too much about her own problems—
her repression of her lesbianism, her mortality. She felt consumed with
self-hatred.
Natalie Barney, on the other hand, was buoyant, lighthearted, absorbed
in the world around her. Her seductions—and by the end of her life they
numbered well into the hundreds—all had a similar quality: she took the
victim outside herself, directing her attention toward beauty, poetry, the innocence of Sapphic love. She invited her women to participate in a kind of
cult in which they would worship these sublimities. To heighten the cultlike feeling, she involved them in little rituals: they would call each other by
new names, send each other poems in daily telegrams, wear costumes,
make pilgrimages to holy sites. Two things would inevitably happen: the
women would start to direct some of the worshipful feelings they were experiencing toward Natalie, who seemed as lofty and beautiful as the things
she held up to be adored; and, pleasantly diverted into this spiritualized
realm, they would also lose any heaviness they had felt about their bodies,
their selves, their identities. Their repression of their sexuality would melt
away. By the time Natalie kissed or caressed them, it would feel like something innocent, pure, as if they had returned to the Garden of Eden before
the fall.
Religion is the great balm of existence because it takes us outside ourselves, connects us to something larger. As we contemplate the object of
worship (God, nature), our burdens are lifted away. It is wonderful to feel
raised up from the earth, to experience that kind of lightness. No matter
how progressive the times, many of us feel uncomfortable with our bodies,
our animal drives. A seducer who focuses too much attention on the
physical will stir up self-consciousness, and a residue of disgust. So focus
attention on something else. Invite the other person to worship something beautiful in the world. It could be nature, a work of art, even God
(or gods—paganism never goes out of fashion); people are dying to believe in something. Add some rituals. If you can make yourself seem to
resemble the thing you are worshiping—you are natural, aesthetic, noble,
and sublime—your targets will transfer their worship to you. Religion and

spirituality are full of sexual undertones that can be brought to the surface
once you have made your targets lose their self-awareness. From spiritual
ecstasy to sexual ecstasy is but one small step.
Come back to take me, quickly, and lead me far away. Purify me with a great fire of divine love, none of the animal
kind. You are all soul when you want to be, when you feel
it, take me far away from my body.

Keys to Seduction
eligion is the most seductive system that mankind has created. Death
is our greatest fear, and religion offers us the illusion that we are immortal, that something about us will live on. The idea that we are an infinitesimal part of a vast and indifferent universe is terrifying; religion
humanizes this universe, makes us feel important and loved. We are not animals governed by uncontrollable drives, animals that die for no apparent
reason, but creatures made in the image of a supreme being. We too can be
sublime, rational, and good. Anything that feeds a desire or a wished-for illusion is seductive, and nothing can match religion in this arena.
Pleasure is the bait that you use to lure a person into your web. But no
matter how clever a seducer you are, in the back of your targets' mind they
are aware of the endgame, the physical conclusion toward which you are
heading. You may think your target is unrepressed and hungry for pleasure,
but almost all of us are plagued by an underlying unease with our animal
nature. Unless you deal with this unease, your seduction, even when successful in the short term, will be superficial and temporary. Instead, like
Natalie Barney, try to capture your target's soul, to build the foundation of
a deep and lasting seduction. Lure the victim deep into your web with
spirituality, making physical pleasure seem sublime and transcendent. Spirituality will disguise your manipulations, suggesting that your relationship is
timeless, and creating a space for ecstasy in the victim's mind. Remember
that seduction is a mental process, and nothing is more mentally intoxicating than religion, spirituality, and the occult.
In Gustave Flaubert's novel Madame Bovary, Rodolphe Boulanger visits
the country doctor Bovary and finds himself interested in the doctor's
beautiful wife, Emma. Boulanger was brutal and shrewd. He was something of a connoisseur: there had been many women in his life." He senses
that Emma is bored. A few weeks later he manages to run into her at a
county fair, where he gets her alone. He affects an air of sadness and
gloom: "Many's the time I've passed a cemetery in the moonlight and asked
myself if I wouldn't be better off lying there with the rest. . . . " He mentions his bad reputation; he deserves it, he says, but is it his fault? "Do you
really not know that there exist souls that are ceaselessly in torment?" Sev-

eral times he takes Emma's hand, but she politely withdraws it. He talks of
love, the magnetic force that draws two people together. Perhaps it has
roots in some earlier existence, some previous incarnation of their souls.
"Take us, for example. Why should we have met? How did it happen? It
can only be that something in our particular inclinations made us come
closer and closer across the distance that separated us, the way two rivers
flow together." He takes her hand again and this time she lets him hold it.
After the fair, he avoids her for a few weeks, then suddenly shows up,
claiming that he tried to stay away but that fate, destiny, has pulled him
back. He takes Emma riding. When he finally makes his move, in the
woods, she seems frightened and rejects his advances. "You must have some
mistaken idea," he protests. "I have you in my heart like a Madonna on a
pedestal. . . . I beseech you: be my friend, my sister, my angel!" Under the
spell of his words, she lets him hold her and lead her deeper into the
woods, where she succumbs.
Rodolphe's strategy is threefold. First he talks of sadness, melancholy,
discontent, talk that makes him seem nobler than other people, as if life's
common material pursuits could not satisfy him. Next he talks of destiny,
the magnetic attraction of two souls. This makes his interest in Emma seem
not so much a momentary impulse as something timeless, linked to the
movement of the stars. Finally he talks of angels, the elevated and the sublime. By placing everything on the spiritual plane, he distracts Emma from
the physical, makes her feel giddy, and packs a seduction that could have
taken months into a matter of a few encounters.
The references Rodolphe uses might seem cliched by today's standards,
but the strategy itself will never grow old. Simply adapt it to the occult fads
of the day. Affect a spiritual air by displaying a discontent with the banalities of life. It is not money or sex or success that moves you; your drives are
never so base. No, something much deeper motivates you. Whatever this is,
keep it vague, letting the target imagine your hidden depths. The stars, astrology, fate, are always appealing; create the sense that destiny has brought
you and your target together. That will make your seduction feel more
natural. In a world where too much is controlled and manufactured, the
sense that fate, necessity, or some higher power is guiding your relationship
is doubly seductive. If you want to weave religious motifs into your seduction, it is always best to choose some distant, exotic religion with a slightly
pagan air. It is easy to move from pagan spirituality to pagan earthiness.
Timing counts: once you have stirred your targets' souls, move quickly to
the physical, making sexuality seem merely an extension of the spiritual vibrations you are experiencing. In other words, employ the spiritual strategy
as close to the time for your bold move as possible.
The spiritual is not exclusively the religious or the occult. It is anything
that will add a sublime, timeless quality to your seduction. In the modern
world, culture and art have in some ways taken the place of religion. There
are two ways to use art in your seduction: first, create it yourself, in the target's honor. Natalie Barney wrote poems, and barraged her targets with

the girl's beauty was

Alibech stared at this in
amazement and said: •
"Rustico, what is that I see
sticking out in front of
you, which I do not
possess?" • "Oh, my
daughter," said Rustico,
"this is the devil I was
telling you about. Do you
see what he's doing? He's
hurting me so much that I
can hardly endure it. " •
"Oh, praise be to God,"
said the girl, "I can see
that I am better off than
you are, for I have no such
devil to contend with." •
"You're right there;" said
Rustico. "But you have
something else instead, that
I haven't." • "Oh?" said
Alibech. "And what's
that?" • "You have Hell,"
said Rustico. "And I
honestly believe that God
has sent you here for the
salvation of my soul,
because if this devil
continues to plague the life
out of me, and if you are
prepared to take sufficient
pity upon me to let me put
him back into Hell, you
will be giving me
marvelous relief, as well as
rendering incalculable
service and pleasure to
God, which is what you
say you came here for in
the first place." • "Oh,
Father," replied the girl in
all innocence, "if I really
do have Hell, let's do as
you suggest just as soon as
you are ready." • "God
bless you, my daughter,"
said Rustico. "Let's go and
put him back, and then
perhaps he'll leave me
alone. " • At which point

he conveyed the girl to one
of their beds, where he
instructed her in the art of
incarcerating that accursed
fiend. • Never having put
a single devil into Hell
before, the girl found the
first experience a little
painful, and she said to
Rustico: • "This devil
must certainly be a bad lot,
Father, and a true enemy
of God, for as well as
plaguing mankind, he even
hurts Hell when he's
driven back inside it. " •
"Daughter," said Rustico,
"it will not always be like
that." And in order to
ensure that it wouldn't,
before moving from the bed
they put him back half a
dozen times, curbing his
arrogance to such good
effect that he was positively
glad to keep still for the rest
of the day. • During the
next few days, however, the
devil's pride frequently
reared its head again, and
the girl, ever ready to obey
the call to duty and bring
him under control,
happened to develop a taste
for the sport, and began
saying to Rustico: • "I can
certainly see what those
worthy men in Gafsa
meant when they said that
serving God was so
agreeable. I don't honestly
recall ever having done
anything that gave me so
much pleasure and
satisfaction as I get from
putting the devil back in
Hell. To my way of
thinking, anyone who
devotes his energies to
anything but the service of
God is a complete
blockhead." • . . . And so,
young ladies, if you stand
in need of God's grace, see

them. Half of Picasso's appeal to many women was the hope that he would
immortalize them in his paintings—for Ars longa, vita brevis (Art is long, life
is short), as they used to say in Rome. Even if your love is a passing fancy,
by capturing it in a work of art you give it a seductive illusion of eternity.
The second way to use art is to make it ennoble the affair, giving your seduction an elevated edge. Natalie Barney took her targets to the theater, to
the opera, to museums, to places full of history and atmosphere. In such
places your souls can vibrate to the same spiritual wavelength. Of course
you should avoid works of art that are earthy or vulgar, calling attention to
your intentions. The play, movie, or book can be contemporary, even a little raw, as long as it contains a noble message and is tied to some just cause.
Even a political movement can be spiritually uplifting. Remember to tailor
your spiritual lures to the target. If the target is earthy and cynical, paganism or art will be more productive than the occult or religious piety.
The Russian mystic Rasputin was revered for his saintliness and his
healing powers. Women in particular were fascinated with Rasputin and
would visit him in his St. Petersburg apartment for spiritual guidance. He
would talk to them of the simple goodness of the Russian peasantry, God's
forgiveness, and other lofty matters. But after a few minutes of this, he
would inject a comment or two that were of a much different nature—
something about the woman's beauty, her lips that were so inviting, the desires she could inspire in a man. He would talk of different kinds of
love—love of God, love between friends, love between a man and a
woman—but mix them all up as if they were one. Then as he returned to
discussing spiritual matters, he would suddenly take the woman's hand, or
whisper into her ear. All this would have an intoxicating effect—women
would find themselves dragged into a kind of maelstrom, both spiritually
uplifted and sexually excited. Hundreds of women succumbed during
these spiritual visits, for he would also tell them that they could not repent
until they had sinned, and who better to sin with than Rasputin.
Rasputin understood the intimate connection between the sexual and
the spiritual. Spirituality, the love of God, is a sublimated version of sexual
love. The language of the religious mystics of the Middle Ages is full of
erotic images; the contemplation of God and of the sublime can offer a
kind of mental orgasm. There is no more seductive brew than the combination of the spiritual and the sexual, the high and the low. When you talk
of spiritual matters, then, let your looks and physical presence hint of sexuality at the same time. Make the harmony of the universe and union with
God seem to confuse with physical harmony and the union between two
people. If you can make the endgame of your seduction appear as a spiritual experience, you will heighten the physical pleasure and create a seduction with a deep and lasting effect.

Reversal
etting your targets feel that your affection is neither temporary nor
superficial will often make them fall deeper under your spell. In some,
though, it can arouse an anxiety: the fear of commitment, of a claustrophobic relationship with no exits. Never let your spiritual lures seem to be
leading in that direction, then. To focus attention on the distant future may
implicitly constrict their freedom; you should be seducing them, not offering to marry them. What you want is to make them lose themselves in the
moment, experiencing the timeless depth of your feelings in the present
tense. Religious ecstasy is about intensity, not temporal extensity.
Giovanni Casanova used many spiritual lures in his seductions—the occult, anything that would inspire lofty sentiments. For the time that he was
involved with a woman, she would feel that he would do anything for her,
that he was not just using her only to abandon her. But she also knew that
when it became convenient to end the affair, he would cry, give her a magnificent gift, then quietly leave. This was just what many young women
wanted—a temporary diversion from marriage or an oppressive family.
Sometimes pleasure is best when we know it is fleeting.

Mix Pleasure with Pain

The
greatest mistake in seduction is being too nice.
At first, perhaps, your kindness is charming, but it soon grows
monotonous; you are trying too hard to please, and seem insecure. Instead
of overwhelming your targets with niceness, try inflicting some pain. Lure them
in with focused attention, then change direction, appearing suddenly uninterested.
Make them feel guilty and insecure. Even instigate a breakup, subjecting them to an
emptiness and pain that will give you room to maneuver—now a rapprochement,
an apology, a return to your earlier kindness, will turn them weak at the
knees. The lower the lows you create, the greater the highs. To
heighten the erotic charge, create the excitement
of fear.

Interpretation. Don Mateo and Conchita Perez are characters in the 1896
novella Woman and Puppet, by Pierre Louÿs. Based on a true story—the
"Miss Charpillon" episode in Casanova's Memoirs—the novella has served as
the basis for two films: Josef von Sternberg's Devil Is a Woman, with Marlene Dietrich, and Luis Buñuel's That Obscure Object of Desire. In Louÿs's
story, Conchita takes a proud and aggressive older man and in the space of a
few months turns him into an abject slave. Her method is simple: she stimulates as many emotions as possible, including heavy doses of pain. She excites his lust, then makes him feel base for taking advantage of her. She gets
him to play the protector, then makes him feel guilty for trying to buy her.

insecurities of the subject, who would get emotional and defensive; deep
down, though, something else would stir inside them—the desire to prove
to Fallaci that they did not deserve her implicit criticisms. Unconsciously
they wanted to please her, to make her like them. When she then shifted
tone, indirectly praising them, they felt they were winning her over and
were encouraged to open up. Without realizing it, they would give freer
rein to their emotions.
In social situations we all wear masks, and keep our defenses up. It is
embarrassing, after all, to reveal one's true feelings. As a seducer you must
find a way to lower these resistances. The Charmer's approach of flattery
and attention can be effective here, particularly with the insecure, but it can
take months of work, and can also backfire. To get a quicker result, and to
break down more inaccessible people, it is often better to alternate harshness and kindness. By being harsh you create inner tensions—your targets
may be upset with you, but they are also asking themselves questions. What
have they done to earn your dislike? When you then are kind, they feel
relieved, but also concerned that at any moment they might somehow displease you again. Make use of this pattern to keep them in suspense—
dreading your harshness and keen to keep you kind. Your kindness and
harshness should be subtle; indirect digs and compliments are best. Play the
psychoanalyst: make cutting comments concerning their unconscious motives (you are only being truthful), then sit back and listen. Your silence will
goad them into embarrassing admissions. Leaven your judgments with occasional praise and they will strive to please you, like dogs.
Love is a costly flower, but one must have the desire to
pluck it from the edge of a precipice.
—STENDHAL

Keys to Seduction
lmost everyone is more or less polite. We learn early on not to tell
people what we really think of them; we smile at their jokes, act interested in their stories and problems. It is the only way to live with them.
Eventually this becomes a habit; we are nice, even when it isn't really necessary. We try to please other people, to not step on their toes, to avoid disagreements and conflict.
Niceness in seduction, however, though it may at first draw someone to
you (it is soothing and comforting), soon loses all effect. Being too nice can
literally push the target away from you. Erotic feeling depends on the creation of tension. Without tension, without anxiety and suspense, there can
be no feeling of release, of true pleasure and joy It is your task to create
that tension in the target, to stimulate feelings of anxiety, to lead them to
and fro, so that the culmination of the seduction has real weight and intensity. So rid yourself of your nasty habit of avoiding conflict, which is in any

bracing—it makes them feel more alive. They have something to complain
about, they get to play the victim. As a result, once you have turned the
pain into pleasure they will readily forgive you. Stir up their jealousy, make
them feel insecure, and the validation you later give their ego by preferring
them over their rivals is doubly delightful. Remember: you have more to
fear by boring your targets than by shaking them up. Wounding people
binds them to you more deeply than kindness. Create tension so you can
release it. If you need inspiration, find the part of the target that most irritates you and use it as a springboard for some therapeutic conflict. The
more real your cruelty, the more effective it is.
In 1818, the French writer Stendhal, then living in Milan, met the
Countess Metilda Viscontini. For him, it was love at first sight. She was a
proud, somewhat difficult woman, and she intimidated Stendhal, who was
terribly afraid of displeasing her with a stupid comment or undignified act.
Finally, unable to take it any longer, he one day took her hand and confessed
his love. Horrified, the countess told him to leave and never come back.
Stendhal flooded Viscontini with letters, begging her to forgive him. At
last, she relented: she would see him again, but under one condition—he
could visit only once every two weeks, for no more than an hour, and only
in the presence of company. Stendhal agreed; he had no choice. He now
lived for those short fortnightly visits, which became occasions of intense
anxiety and fear, since he was never quite sure whether she would change
her mind and banish him forever. This went on for over two years, during
which the countess never showed him the slightest sign of favor. Stendhal
never found out why she had insisted on this arrangement—perhaps she
wanted to toy with him or keep him at a distance. All he knew was that his
love for her only grew stronger, became unbearably intense, until finally he
had to leave Milan.
To get over this sad affair, Stendhal wrote his famous book On Love, in
which he described the effect of fear on desire. First, if you fear the loved
one, you can never get too close or familiar with him or her. The beloved
then retains an element of mystery, which only intensifies your love. Second, there is something bracing about fear. It makes you vibrate with sensation, heightens your awareness, is intensely erotic. According to Stendhal,
the closer the loved one brings you to the edge of the precipice, to the feeling that they could abandon you, the dizzier and more lost you will become. Falling in love means literally falling—losing control, a mix of fear
and excitement.
Apply this wisdom in reverse: never let your targets get too comfortable

with you. They need to feel fear and anxiety. Show them some coldness, a
flash of anger they did not expect. Be irrational if necessary. There is always
the trump card: a breakup. Let them feel they have lost you forever, make
them fear that they have lost the power to charm you. Let these feelings sit
with them for a while, then pull them back from the precipice. The reconciliation will be intense.
In 33 B.C., Mark Antony heard a rumor that Cleopatra, his lover of
several years, had decided to seduce his rival, Octavius, and that she was
planning to poison Antony. Cleopatra had poisoned people before; in fact
she was an expert in the art. Antony grew paranoid, and finally one day
confronted her. Cleopatra did not protest her innocence. Yes, that was true,
it was quite within her power to poison Antony at any moment; there were
no precautions he could take. Only the love she felt for him could protect
him. To demonstrate, she took some flowers and dropped them into his
wine. Antony hesitated, then raised the cup to his lips; Cleopatra grabbed
his arm and stopped him. She had a prisoner brought in to drink the wine,
and the prisoner promptly dropped dead. Falling at Cleopatra's feet,
Antony professed that he loved her now more than ever. He did not speak
out of cowardice; there was no man braver than he, and if Cleopatra could
have poisoned him, he for his part could have left her and gone back to
Rome. No, what pushed him over the edge was the feeling that she had
control over his emotions, over life and death. He was her slave. Her
demonstration of her power over him was not only effective but erotic.
Like Antony, many of us have masochistic yearnings without realizing
it. It takes someone to inflict some pain on us for these deeply repressed desires to come to the surface. You must learn to recognize the types of hidden masochists out there, for each one enjoys a particular kind of pain. For
instance, there are people who feel that they deserve nothing good in life,
and who, unable to deal with success, sabotage themselves constantly. Be
nice to them, admit that you admire them, and they are uncomfortable,
since they feel that they cannot possibly match up to the ideal figure you
have clearly imagined them to be. Such self-saboteurs do better with a little
punishment; scold them, make them aware of their inadequacies. They feel
they deserve such criticism and when it comes it is with a sense of relief. It
is also easy to make them feel guilty, a feeling that deep down they enjoy.
Other people experience the responsibilities and duties of modern life
as such a heavy burden, they long to give it all up. These people are often
looking for someone or something to worship—a cause, a religion, a guru.
Make them worship you. And then there are those who want to play the
martyr. Recognize them by the joy they take in complaining, in feeling
righteous and wronged; then give them a reason to complain. Remember:
appearances deceive. Often the strongest-looking people—the Kissingers
and Don Mateos—may secretly want to be punished. In any event, follow
up pain with pleasure and you will create a state of dependency that will
last for a long time.

Mix Pleasure with Pain

Symbol: The Precipice. At the edge of a cliff, people often feel
lightheaded, both fearful and dizzy. For a moment they
can imagine themselves falling headlong. At the
same time, a part of them is tempted. Lead
your targets as close to the edge as
possible, then pull them
back. No thrill
without

fear.

Reversal
eople who have recently experienced a lot of pain or a loss will flee if
you try to inflict more on them. They have enough in their lives already. Far better to surround these types with pleasure—that will put them
under your spell. The technique of inflicting pain works best on those who
have it easy, who have power and few problems. People with comfortable
lives may also feel a gnawing sense of guilt, as if they had gotten away with
something. They may not consciously know it, but secretly they long for
some punishment, a good mental thrashing, something that will bring
them back down to earth.
Also, remember to not use the pleasure-through-pain tactic too early
on. Some of the greatest seducers in history—Byron, Jiang Qing (Madame
Mao), Picasso—had a sadistic streak, an ability to inflict mental torture. If
their victims had known in advance what they were getting themselves
into, they would have run for the hills. In truth, most of these seducers
lured their targets into their webs by appearing to be paragons of sweetness
and affection. Even Byron seemed like an angel when he first met a
woman, so that she tended to doubt his devilish reputation—a seductive
doubt, for it allowed her to think of herself as the only one who really
understood him. His cruelty would come out later on, but by then it would
be too late. The victim's emotions were engaged, and his harshness would
only intensify her feelings.

Phase Four

Moving In for the Kill

First you worked on their mind—the mental seduction. Then you
confused and stirred them up—the emotional seduction. Now the
time has come for hand-to-hand combat—the physical seduction.
At this point, your victims are weak and ripe with desire: by show-.
ing a little coldness or uninterest, you will spark panic—they will
come after you with impatience and erotic energy (21: Give them
space to fall—the pursuer is pursued). To bring them to a boil, you
need to put their minds to sleep and heat up their senses. It is best
to lure them into lust by sending certain loaded signals that will get
under their skin and spread sexual desire like a poison (22: Use
physical lures). The moment to strike and move in for the kill is
when your victim is brimming with desire, but not consciously expecting the climax to come (23: Master the art of the bold move).

Once the seduction is over, there is the danger that disenchantment will set in and ruin all your hard work (24: Beware the
aftereffects). If you are after a relationship, then you must constantly re-seduce the victim, creating tension and releasing it. If
your victim is to be sacrificed, then it must be done swiftly and
cleanly, leaving you free (physically and psychologically) to move
on

to

the

next victim.

Then

the game begins

all over.

Give Them Space to Fall—
The Pursuer Is Pursued

If your targets become too used to you as the aggressor, they will give less of their own energy, and the
tension will slacken. You need to wake them up, turn the
tables. Once they are under your spell, take a step back and
they will start to come after you. Begin with a touch of aloofness, an unexpected nonappearance, a hint that you are growing bored. Stir the pot by seeming interested in someone else.
Make none of this explicit; let them only sense it and their
imagination will do the rest, creating the doubt you desire.
Soon they will want to possess you physically, and restraint will go out the window. The goal is to have them
fall into your arms of their own will. Create the
illusion that the seducer is being seduced.

Seductive Gravity
n the early 1840s, the center of attention in the French art world was a
young woman named Apollonie Sabatier. She was so much the natural
beauty that sculptors and painters vied to immortalize her in their works,
and she was also charming, easy to talk to, and seductively self-sufficient—
men were drawn to her. Her Paris apartment became a gathering spot for
writers and artists, and soon Madame Sabatier—as she came to be known, Omissions, denials,

Clearly the author was haunted by Sabatier's presence, and thought of her
constantly—but now she began to be haunted by him, thinking of him
night and day, and wondering who he was. His subsequent letters only
deepened the spell. It was flattering to hear that he was enchanted by more
than her beauty, yet also flattering to know that he was not immune to her
physical charms.
One day an idea occurred to Madame Sabatier as to who the writer
might be: a young poet who had frequented her salon for several years,
Charles Baudelaire. He seemed shy, in fact had hardly spoken to her, but
she had read some of his poetry, and although the poems in the letters were
more polished, the style was similar. At her apartment Baudelaire would always sit politely in a corner, but now that she thought of it, he would smile
at her strangely, nervously. It was the look of a young man in love. Now
when he visited she watched him carefully, and the more she watched, the
surer she was that he was the writer, but she never confirmed her intuition,
because she did not want to confront him—he might be shy, but he was a
man, and at some point he would have to come to her. And she felt certain
that he would. Then, suddenly the letters stopped coming—and Madame
Sabatier could not understand why, since the last one had been even more
adoring than all of the others before.
Several years went by, in which she often thought of her anonymous
admirer's letters, but they were never renewed. In 1857, however, Baudelaire published a book of poetry, The Flowers of Evil, and Madame Sabatier
recognized several of the verses—they were the ones he had written for
her. Now they were out in the open for everyone to see. A little while later
the poet sent her a gift: a specially bound copy of the book, and a letter,
this time signed with his name. Yes, he wrote, he was the anonymous
writer—would she forgive him for being so mysterious in the past?
Furthermore, his feelings for her were as strong as ever: "You didn't think
for a moment that I could have forgotten you? . . . You to me are more
than a cherished image conjured up in dream, you're my superstition . . .
my constant companion, my secret! Farewell, dear Madame. I kiss your
hands with profound devotion."
This letter had a stronger effect on Madame Sabatier than the others
had. Perhaps it was his childlike sincerity, and the fact that he had finally
written to her directly; perhaps it was that he loved her but asked nothing
of her, unlike all the other men she knew who at some point had always
turned out to want something. Whatever it was, she had an uncontrollable
desire to see him. The next day she invited him to her apartment, alone.

Interpretation. Baudelaire was an intellectual seducer. He wanted to overwhelm Madame Sabatier with words, dominate her thoughts, make her fall
in love with him. Physically, he knew, he could not compete with her

he resorted to his one strength, poetry. Haunting her with anonymous letters gave him a perverse thrill. He had to know she would realize, eventually, that he was her correspondent—no one else wrote like him—but he

sexless neutrality. Be friendly, even warm, but no more. You are pushing
them into arming themselves with the seductive charms that are natural to
their sex—exactly what you want.
In the latter stages of the seduction, let your targets feel that you are becoming interested in another person—this is another form of taking a step
back. When Napoleon Bonaparte first met the young widow Josephine de
Beauharnais in 1795, he was excited by her exotic beauty and the looks she
gave him. He began to attend her weekly soirees and, to his delight, she
would ignore the other men and remain at his side, listening to him so attentively. He found himself falling in love with Josephine, and had every
reason to believe she felt the same.
Then, at one soiree, she was friendly and attentive, as usual—except
—THEODOR REIK,
that she was equally friendly to another man there, a former aristocrat, like
OF LOVE AND LUST
Josephine, the kind of man that Napoleon could never compete with when
it came to manners and wit. Doubts and jealousies began to stir within. As
a military man, he knew the value of going on the offensive, and after a few
weeks of a swift and aggressive campaign he had her all to himself, eventually marrying her. Of course Josephine, a clever seductress, had set it all up.
She did not say she was interested in another man, but his mere presence
at her house, a look here and there, subtle gestures, made it seem that way.
There is no more powerful way to hint that you are losing your desire. Make
your interest in another too obvious, though, and it could backfire. This is
not the situation in which you want to seem cruel; doubt and anxiety
are the effects you are after. Make your possible interest in another barely
perceptible to the naked eye.
Once someone has fallen for you, any physical absence will create unease. You are literally creating space. The Russian seductress Lou AndreasSalomé had an intense presence; when a man was with her, he felt her eyes
boring into him, and often became entranced with her coquettish ways and
spirit. But then, almost invariably, something would come up—she would
have to leave town for a while, or would be too busy to see him. It was
during her absences that men fell hopelessly in love with her, and vowed to
be more aggressive next time they were with her. Your absences at this
latter point of the seduction should seem at least somewhat justified. You
are insinuating not a blatant brush-off but a slight doubt: perhaps you
could have found some reason to stay, perhaps you are losing interest, perhaps there is someone else. In your absence, their appreciation of you will
grow. They will forget your faults, forgive your sins. The moment you return, they will chase after you as you desire. It will be as if you had come
back from the dead.
According to the psychologist Theodor Reik, we learn to love only
through rejection. As infants, we are showered with love by our mother—
we know nothing else. But when we get a little older, we begin to sense
that her love is not unconditional. If we do not behave, if we do not please
her, she can withdraw it. The idea that she will withdraw her affection fills
us with anxiety, and, at first, with anger—we will show her, we will throw

a tantrum. But that never works, and we slowly realize that the only way to
keep her from rejecting us again is to imitate her—to be as loving, kind,
and affectionate as she is. This will bond her to us in the deepest way. The
pattern is ingrained in us for the rest of our lives: by experiencing a rejection or a coldness, we learn to court and pursue, to love.
Re-create this primal pattern in your seduction. First, shower your targets with affection. They will not be sure where this is coming from, but it
is a delightful feeling, and they will never want to lose it. When it does go
away, in your strategic step back, they will have moments of anxiety and
anger, perhaps throwing a tantrum, and then the same childlike reaction:
the only way to win you back, to have you for sure, will be to reverse the
pattern, to imitate you, to be the affectionate, giving one. It is the terror of
rejection that turns the tables.
This pattern will often repeat itself naturally in an affair or relationship.
One person goes cold, the other pursues, then goes cold in turn, making
the first person the pursuer, and on and on. As a seducer, do not leave this
to chance. Make it happen. You are teaching the other person to become a
seducer, just as the mother in her own way taught the child to return her
love by turning her back. For your own sake learn to relish this reversal of
roles. Do not merely play at being the pursued, but enjoy it, give in to it.
The pleasure of being pursued by your victim can often surpass the thrill of
the hunt.

here are moments when creating space and absence will blow up in
your face. An absence at a critical moment in the seduction can make
the target lose interest in you. It also leaves too much to chance—while you
are away, they could find another person, who will distract their thoughts
from you. Cleopatra easily seduced Mark Antony, but after their first encounters, he returned to Rome. Cleopatra was mysterious and alluring, but
if she let too much time pass, he would forget her charms. So she let go of
her usual coquetry and came after him when he was on one of his military
campaigns. She knew that once he saw her, he would fall under her spell
again and pursue her.
Use absence only when you are sure of the target's affection, and never
let it go on too long. It is most effective later in the seduction. Also, never
create too much space—don't write too rarely, don't act too cold, don't
show too much interest in someone else. That is the strategy of mixing
pleasure with pain, detailed in chapter 20, and will create a dependent victim, or will even make him or her give up completely. Some people, too,
are inveterately passive: they are waiting for you to make the bold move,
and if you don't, they will think you are weak. The pleasure to be had from
such a victim is less than the pleasure you will get from someone more active. But if you are involved with such a type, do what you need to if you
are to have your way, then end the affair and move on.

Use Physical Lures

doubts. Put their minds gently to rest, and waken
their dormant senses, by combining a nondefensive attitude with a charged sexual presence.
While your cool, nonchalant air is calming
their minds and lowering their inhibitions,
your glances, voice, and bearing—oozing sex
and desire—are getting under their skin, agitating their senses and raising their temperature.
Never force the physical; instead infect your targets
with heat, lure them into lust. Lead them into the
moment—an

intensified present in which mo-

rality, judgment, and concern for the future all melt away and the body
succumbs to pleasure.

Interpretation. Although La Belle Otero was beautiful, hundreds of
women were more so, or were more charming and talented. But Otero was
constantly on fire. Men could read it in her eyes, the way her body moved,
a dozen other signs. The heat that radiated out from her came from her
own inner desires: she was insatiably sexual. But she was also a practiced
and calculating courtesan, and knew how to put her sexuality to effect.

Lowering Inhibitions

O

ne day in 1931, in a village in New Guinea, a young girl named Tuperselai heard some happy news: her father, Allaman, who had left
some months before to work on a tobacco plantation, had returned for a
visit. Tuperselai ran to greet him. Accompanying her father was a white
man, an unusual sight in these parts. He was a twenty-two-year-old Australian from Tasmania, and he was the owner of the plantation. His name
was Errol Flynn.
Flynn smiled warmly at Tuperselai, seeming particularly interested in
her bare breasts. (As was the custom in New Guinea then, she wore only a
grass skirt.) He said in pidgin English how beautiful she was, and kept repeating her name, which he pronounced remarkably well. He did not say

much else, mind you—he did not speak her language—so she said goodbye
and walked away with her father. But later that day she discovered, to her
dismay, that Mr. Flynn had taken a liking to her and had purchased her
from her father for two pigs, some English coins, and some seashell money.
The family was poor and the father liked the price. Tuperselai had a
boyfriend in the village whom she did not want to leave, but she did not
dare disobey her father, and she left with Mr. Flynn for the tobacco plantation. On the other hand, she had no intention of being friendly with this
man, from whom she expected the worst kind of treatment.
In the first few days, Tuperselai missed her village terribly, and felt nervous and out of sorts. But Mr. Flynn was polite, and talked in a soothing
voice. She began to relax, and since he kept his distance, she decided it was
safe to approach him. His white skin was tasty to the mosquitoes, so she began to wash him every night with scented bush herbs to keep them away.
Soon she had a thought: Mr. Flynn was lonely, and wanted a companion.
That was why he had bought her. At night he usually read; instead, she began to entertain him by singing and dancing. Sometimes he tried to communicate in words and gestures, struggling in pidgin. She had no idea what

about that, Flynn replied; and the following day he showed up at their
house with a beautiful gift for Blanca, a ring with her birthstone. Melting
under his charming smile, Blanca's mother agreed to his plan. Later that
day, Blanca found herself on a plane to Acapulco. It was all like a dream.
The Davises, under orders from Blanca's mother, tried not to let her
out of their sight, so Flynn put her on a raft and they drifted out into the
ocean, far from the shore. His flattering words filled her ears, and she let
him hold her hand and kiss her cheek. That night they danced together,
and when the evening was over he escorted her to her room and serenaded
her with a song as they finally parted. It was the end of a perfect day. In the
middle of the night, she woke up to hear him calling her name, from her
hotel-room balcony. How had he gotten there? His room was a floor
above; he must have somehow jumped or swung down, a dangerous maneuver. She approached, not at all afraid, but curious. He pulled her gently
into his arms and kissed her. Her body convulsed; overwhelmed with new
sensations, totally at sea, she began to cry—out of happiness, she said.
Flynn comforted her with a kiss and returned to his room above, in the
same inexplicable way he had arrived. Now Blanca was hopelessly in love
with him and would do anything he asked of her. A few weeks later, in
fact, she followed him to Hollywood, where she went on to become a successful actress, known as Linda Christian.
In 1942, an eighteen-year-old girl named Nora Eddington had a temporary job selling cigarettes at the Los Angeles County courthouse. The
place was a madhouse at the time, teeming with tabloid journalists: two
young girls had charged Errol Flynn with rape. Nora of course noticed
Flynn, a tall, dashing man who occasionally bought cigarettes from her, but
her thoughts were with her boyfriend, a young Marine. A few weeks later
Flynn was acquitted, the trial ended, and the place settled down. A man she
had met during the trial called her up one day: he was Flynn's right-hand
man, and on Flynn's behalf, he wanted to invite her up to the actor's house
on Mulholland Drive. Nora had no interest in Flynn, and in fact she was a
little afraid of him, but a girlfriend who was dying to meet him talked her
into going and bringing her along. What did she have to lose? Nora agreed
to go. On the day, Flynn's friend showed up and drove them to a splendid
house on top of a hill. When they arrived, Flynn was standing shirtless by
his swimming pool. He came to greet her and her girlfriend, moving so
gracefully—like a lithe cat—and his manner so relaxed, she felt her jitters
melt away. He gave them a tour of the house, which was full of artifacts of
his various sea voyages. He talked so delightfully of his love of adventure
that she wished she had had adventures of her own. He was the perfect
gentleman, and even let her talk about her boyfriend without the slightest
sign of jealousy.
Nora had a visit from her boyfriend the next day. Somehow he didn't
seem so interesting anymore; they had a fight and broke up on the spot.
That night, Flynn took her out on the town, to the famous Mocambo
nightclub. He was drinking and joking, and she fell into the spirit, and hap-

to touch will trigger vision: casual or "accidental" contact—better a brushing of the skin than something more forceful right now—will create a
jolt and activate the eyes. Subtly modulate the voice, make it slower and
deeper. Living senses will crowd out rational thought.
In the eighteenth-century libertine novel The Wayward Head and Heart,
by Crébillon fils, Madame de Lursay is trying to seduce a younger man,
Meilcour. Her weapons are several. One night at a party she is hosting, she
wears a revealing gown; her hair is slightly tousled; she throws him heated
glances; her voice trembles a bit. When they are alone, she innocently gets
him to sit close to her, and talks more slowly; at one point she starts to cry.
Meilcour has many reasons to resist her; he has fallen in love with a girl his
own age, and he has heard rumors about Madame de Lursay that should
make him distrust her. But the clothes, the looks, the perfume, the voice,
the closeness of her body, the tears—it all begins to overwhelm him. "An
indescribable agitation stirred my senses." Meilcour succumbs.
The French libertines of the eighteenth century called this "the moment." The seducer leads the victim to a point where he or she reveals involuntary signs of physical excitation that can be read in various symptoms.
Once those signs are detected, the seducer must work quickly, applying
pressure on the target to get lost in the moment—the past, the future, all
moral scruples vanishing in air. Once your victims lose themselves in the
moment, it is all over—their mind, their conscience, no longer holds them
back. The body gives in to pleasure. Madame de Lursay lures Meilcour into
the moment by creating a generalized disorder of the senses, rendering him
incapable of thinking straight.
In leading your victims into the moment, remember a few things. First,

with the sailors' song that
drifts to me \ Are mingled
odors of the tamarind, \
— A n d all my soul is scent
and melody.

Use Physical Lures

a disordered look (Madame de Lursay's tousled hair, her ruffled dress) has
more effect on the senses than a neat appearance. It suggests the bedroom.
Second, be alert to the signs of physical excitation. Blushing, trembling of
the voice, tears, unusually forceful laughter, relaxing movements of the
body (any kind of involuntary mirroring, their gestures imitating yours), a
revealing slip of the tongue—these are signs that the victim is slipping into
the moment and pressure is to be applied.
In 1934, a Chinese football player named Li met a young actress named
Lan Ping in Shanghai. He began to see her often at his matches, cheering
him on. They would meet at public affairs, and he would notice her glancing at him with her "strange, yearning eyes," then looking away. One evening he found her seated next to him at a reception. Her leg brushed up
against his. They chatted, and she asked him to see a movie with her at a
nearby cinema. Once they were there, her head found its way onto his
shoulder; she whispered into his ear, something about the film. Later they
strolled the streets, and she put her arm around his waist. She brought him
to a restaurant where they drank some wine. Li took her to his hotel room,
and there he found himself overwhelmed by caresses and sweet words. She
gave him no room to retreat, no time to cool down. Three years later Lan
Ping—soon to be renamed Jiang Qing—played a similar game on Mao Zedong. She was to become Mao's wife—the infamous Madame Mao, leader
of the Gang of Four.
Seduction, like warfare, is often a game of distance and closeness. At
first you track your enemy from a distance. Your main weapons are your
eyes, and a mysterious manner. Byron had his famous underlook, Madame
Mao her yearning eyes. The key is to make the look short and to the point,
then look away, like a rapier glancing the flesh. Make your eyes reveal desire, and keep the rest of the face still. (A smile will spoil the effect.) Once
the victim is heated up, you quickly bridge the distance, turning to handto-hand combat in which you give the enemy no room to withdraw, no
time to think or to consider the position in which you have placed him or
her. To take the element of fear out of this, use flattery, make the target feel
more masculine or feminine, praise their charms. It is their fault that you
have become so physical and aggressive. There is no greater physical lure
than to make the target feel alluring. Remember: the girdle of Aphrodite,
which gave her untold seductive powers, included that of sweet flattery.
Shared physical activity is always an excellent lure. The Russian mystic
Rasputin would begin his seductions with a spiritual lure—the promise of
a shared religious experience. But then his eyes would bore into his target
at a party, and inevitably he would lead her in a dance, which would become more and more suggestive as he moved closer to her. Hundreds of
women succumbed to this technique. For Flynn it was swimming or sailing. In such physical activity, the mind turns off and the body operates according to its own laws. The target's body will follow your lead, will mirror
your moves, as far as you want it to go.
In the moment, all moral considerations fade away, and the body re-

turns to a state of innocence. You can partly create that feeling through a
devil-may-care attitude. You do not worry about the world, or what people think of you; you do not judge your target in any way. Part of Flynn's
appeal was his total acceptance of a woman. He was not interested in a particular body type, a woman's race, her level of education, her political beliefs. He was in love with her feminine presence. He was luring her into an
adventure, free of society's strictures and moral judgments. With him she
could act out a fantasy—which, for many, was the chance to be aggressive
or transgressive, to experience danger. So empty yourself of your tendency
to moralize and judge. You have lured your targets into a momentary world
of pleasure—soft and accommodating, all rules and taboos thrown out the
window.

ome people panic when they sense they are falling into the moment.
Often, using spiritual lures will help disguise the increasingly physical
nature of the seduction. That is how the lesbian seductress Natalie Barney
operated. In her heyday, at the turn of the twentieth century, lesbian sex
was immensely transgressive, and women new to it often felt a sense of
shame or dirtiness. Barney led them into the physical, but so enveloped it
in poetry and mysticism that they relaxed and felt purified by the experience. Today, few people feel repulsed by their sexual nature, but many are
uncomfortable with their bodies. A purely physical approach will frighten
and disturb them. Instead, make it seem a spiritual, mystical union, and
they will take less notice of your physical manipulations.

Master the Art of the Bold Move

A

moment has

arrived: your victim clearly desires you,
but is not ready to admit it openly, let alone act on it.
This is the time to throw aside chivalry, kindness, and coquetry
and to overwhelm with a bold move. Don't give the victim time to consider
the consequences; create conflict, stir up tension, so that the bold move comes as
a great release. Showing hesitation or awkwardness means you are thinking of
yourself, as opposed to being overwhelmed by the victim's charms. Never hold
back or meet the target halfway, under the belief that you are being
correct and considerate; you must be seductive now, not
political. One person must go on the offensive, and it is you.

tures a democratizing, leveling impulse, in which everything has to seem at
least something like equal. An overt imbalance of power, an overt desire for
power, will stir envy and resentment; we learn to be kind and polite, at least
on the surface. Even those who have power generally try to act humble and
modest—they do not want to offend. In seduction, on the other hand, you
can throw all of that out, revel in your dark side, inflict a little pain—in
some ways be more yourself. Your naturalness in this respect will prove seductive in itself. The problem is that after years of living in the real world,
we lose the ability to be ourselves. We become timid, humble, overpolite.
Your task is to regain some of your childhood qualities, to root out all this
false humility. And the most important quality to recapture is boldness.
No one is born timid; timidity is a protection we develop. If we never
stick our necks out, if we never try, we will never have to suffer the consequences of failure or success. If we are kind and unobtrusive, no one will
be offended—in fact we will seem saintly and likable. In truth, timid people are often self-absorbed, obsessed with the way people see them, and not
at all saintly. And humility may have its social uses, but it is deadly in seduction. You need to be able to play the humble saint at times; it is a mask you
wear. But in seduction, take it off. Boldness is bracing, erotic, and absolutely necessary to bring the seduction to its conclusion. Done right, it
tells your targets that they have made you lose your normal restraint, and
gives them license to do so as well. People are yearning to have a chance to
play out the repressed sides of their personality. At the final stage of a seduction, boldness eliminates any awkwardness or doubts. In a dance, two
people cannot lead. One takes over, sweeping the other along. Seduction is
not egalitarian; it is not a harmonic convergence. Holding back at the end
out of fear of offending, or thinking it correct to share the power, is a
recipe for disaster. This is an arena not for politics but for pleasure. It can be
by the man or woman, but a bold move is required. If you are so concerned about the other person, console yourself with the thought that
the pleasure of the one who surrenders is often greater than that of the
aggressor.
As a young man, the actor Errol Flynn was uncontrollably bold. This
often got him into trouble; he became too aggressive around desirable
women. Then, while traveling through the Far East, he became interested
in the Asian practice of tantric sex, in which the male must train himself
not to ejaculate, preserving his potency and heightening both partners'
pleasure in the process. Flynn later applied this principle to his seductions as
well, teaching himself to restrain his natural boldness and delay the end of
the seduction as long as possible. So, while boldness can work wonders, uncontrollable boldness is not seductive but frightening; you need to be able
to turn it on and off at will, know when to use it. As in Tantrism, you can
create more pleasure by delaying the inevitable.

Sometime in the fifteenth century, the writer Bandello relates, a young
Venetian widow had a sudden lust for a handsome nobleman. She had her
father invite him to their palace to discuss business, but during the meeting
the father had to leave, and she offered to give the young man a tour of the
place. His curiosity was piqued by her bedroom, which she described as the
most splendid room in the palace, but which she also passed by without letting him enter. He begged to be shown the room, and she granted his wish.
He was spellbound: the velvets, the rare objets, the suggestive paintings, the
delicate white candles. A beguiling scent filled the room. The widow put
out all of the candles but one, then led the man to the bed, which had been
heated with a warming pan. He quickly succumbed to her caresses. Follow
the widow's example: your bold move should have a theatrical quality to it.
That will make it memorable, and make your aggressiveness seem pleasant,

412

•

part of the drama. The theatricality can come from the setting—an exotic
or sensual location. It can also come from your actions. The widow piqued
her victim's curiosity by creating the suspense about her bedroom. An element of fear—someone might find you, say—will heighten the tension.
Remember: you are creating a moment that must stand out from the sameness of daily life.
Keeping your targets emotional will both weaken them and heighten
the drama of the moment. And the best way to keep them at an emotional
pitch is by infecting them with emotions of your own. When Valmont
wanted the Presidents to become calm, angry, or tender, he showed that
emotion first, and she mirrored it. People are very susceptible to the moods
of those around them; this is particularly acute at the latter stages of a seduction, when resistance is low and the target has fallen under your spell.
At the point of the bold move, learn to infect your target with whatever
emotional mood you require, as opposed to suggesting the mood with
words. You want access to the target's unconscious, which is best obtained
by infecting them with emotions, bypassing their conscious ability to resist.
It may seem expected for the male to make the bold move, but history
is full of successfully bold females. There are two main forms of feminine
boldness. In the first, more traditional form, the coquettish woman stirs
male desire, is completely in control, then at the last minute, after bringing
her victim to a boil, steps back and lets him make the bold move. She sets it
up, then signals with her eyes, her gestures, that she is ready for him. Courtesans have used this method throughout history; it is how Cleopatra
worked on Antony, how Josephine seduced Napoleon, how La Belle Otero
amassed a fortune during the Belle Epoque. It lets the man maintain his
masculine illusions, although the woman is really the aggressor.
The second form of feminine boldness does not bother with such illusions: the woman simply takes charge, initiates the first kiss, pounces on
her victim. This is how Marguerite de Valois, Lou Andreas-Salomé, and
Madame Mao operated, and many men find it not emasculating at all but
very exciting. It all depends on the insecurities and proclivities of the victim. This kind of feminine boldness has its allure because it is more rare
than the first kind, but then all boldness is somewhat rare. A bold move will
always stand out compared to the usual treatment afforded by the tepid husband, the timid lover, the hesitant suitor. That is how you want it. If everyone were bold, boldness would quickly lose its allure.

Beware the Aftereffects

Danger follows
in the aftermath of a successful seduction. After emotions have reached a pitch,
they often swing in the opposite direction—toward
lassitude, distrust, disappointment. Beware of the long,
drawn-out goodbye; insecure, the victim will cling and claw,
and both sides will suffer. If you are to part, make the sacrifice
swift and sudden. If necessary, deliberately break the spell you
have created. If you are to stay in a relationship, beware a flagging of energy, a creeping familiarity that will spoil the
fantasy. If the game is to go on, a second seduction is
required. Never let the other person take you for
granted—use absence, create pain and conflict, to keep the seduced on tenterhooks.

Disenchantment
eduction is a kind of spell, an enchantment. When you seduce, you are
not quite your normal self; your presence is heightened, you are playing
more than one role, you are strategically concealing your tics and insecurities. You have deliberately created mystery and suspense to make the victim

Interpretation. The Marquise de Merteuil, a character in Choderlos de Laclos's novel Dangerous Liaisons, is a practiced seductress who never lets her
affairs drag on too long. De Belleroche is young and handsome but that is
all. As her interest in him wanes, she decides to bring him to the secret
house to try to inject some novelty into the affair. This works for a while,
but it isn't enough. The chevalier must be gotten rid of. She tries coldness,
anger (hoping to start a fight), even a show of interest in another man. All
this only intensifies his attachment. She can't just leave him—he might be- — O V I D , T H E A R T O F L O V E ,

2. King Charles II of England was a devoted libertine. He kept a stable of
lovers: there was always a favorite mistress from the aristocracy, and countless other less important women. He craved variety. One evening in 1668,
the king spent an evening at the theater, where he conceived a sudden desire for a young actress called Nell Gwyn. She was pretty and innocent
looking (only eighteen at the time), with a girlish glow in her cheeks, but
the lines she recited onstage were so impudent and saucy. Deeply excited,
the king decided he had to have her. After the performance he took her
out for a night of drinking and merriment, then led her to his royal bed.
Nell was the daughter of a fishmonger, and had begun by selling oranges in the theater. She rose to the status of actress by sleeping with writers and other theater men. She had no shame about this. (When a footman
of hers got into a fight with someone who said he worked for a whore, she
broke it up by saying, "I am a whore. Find something better to fight
about.") Nell's humor and sass amused the king greatly, but she was lowborn, and an actress, and he could hardly make her a favorite. After several

things was through a man—and who better than the king? But to get involved with Charles was a dangerous game. A man like him, easily bored
and in need of variety, would use her for a fling, then find someone else.
Nell's strategy for the problem was simple: she let the king have his
other girls, and never complained. Every time he saw her, though, she
made sure he was entertained and diverted. She filled his senses with pleasure, acting as if his position had nothing to do with her love for him. Variety in women could wear on the nerves, tiring a busy king. They all made
so many demands. If one woman could provide the same variety (and Nell,
as an actress, knew how to play different roles), she had a big advantage.
Nell never asked for money, so Charles plied her with wealth. She never
asked to be the favorite—how could she? She was a commoner—but he elevated her to the position.
Many of your targets will be like kings and queens, particularly those
who are easily bored. Once the seduction is over they will not only have
trouble idealizing you, they may also turn to another man or woman whose
unfamiliarity seems exciting and poetic. Needing other people to divert
them, they often satisfy this need through variety. Do not play into the
hands of these bored royals by complaining, becoming self-pitying, or demanding privileges. That would only further their natural disenchantment
once the seduction is over. Instead, make them see that you are not the person they thought you were. Make it a delightful game to play new roles, to
surprise them, to be an endless source of entertainment. It is almost impossible to resist a person who provides pleasure with no strings attached.
When they are with you, keep the spirit light and playful. Play up the parts
of your character they find delightful, but never let them feel they know
you too well. In the end you will control the dynamic, and a haughty king
or queen will become your abject slave.

3. When the great jazz composer Duke Ellington came to town, he and his
band were always a big attraction, but especially so for the ladies of the area.
They came to hear his music, of course, but once there they were mesmerized by "the Duke" himself. Onstage, Ellington was relaxed and elegant,
and seemed to be having such a good time. His face was very handsome,
and his bedroom eyes were infamous. (He slept very little, and his eyes had
permanent pouches under them.) After the performance, some woman
would inevitably invite him to her table, another would sneak into his
dressing room, yet another would approach him on his way out. Duke
made a point of being accessible, and when he kissed a woman's hand, his
eyes and hers would meet for a moment. Sometimes she would signal an
interest in him, and his glance in return would say he was more than ready.
Sometimes his eyes were the first to speak; few women could resist that
look, even the most happily married.
With the night's music still ringing in her ears, the woman would show
up at Ellington's hotel room. He would be dressed in a stylish suit—he

husband would not spoil the illusion. Ellington was never defensive or
apologetic about his appetite for women; it was his nature and never the
fault of the woman that he was unfaithful. And if he could not help his desires, how could she hold him responsible? It was impossible to hold a
grudge against such a man or complain about his behavior.
Ellington was an Aesthetic Rake, a type whose obsession with women
can only be satisfied by endless variety. A normal man's tomcatting will
eventually land him in hot water, but the Aesthetic Rake rarely stirs up ugly
emotions. After he seduces a woman, there is neither an integration nor a
sacrifice. He keeps them hanging and hoping. The spell is not broken the
next day, because the Aesthetic Rake makes the separation a pleasant, even
elegant experience. The spell Ellington cast on a woman never went away.
The lesson is simple: keep the moments after the seduction and the
separation in the same key as before, heightened, aesthetic, and pleasant. If
you do not act guilty for your feckless behavior, it is hard for the other person to feel angry or resentful. Seduction is a lighthearted game, in which
you invest all of your energy in the moment. The separation should be
lighthearted and stylish as well: it is work, travel, some dreaded responsibility that calls you away. Create a memorable experience and then move
on, and your victim will most likely remember the delightful seduction,
not the separation. You will have made no enemies, and will have a lifelong
harem of lovers to whom you can always return when you feel so inclined.

4. In 1899, twenty-year-old Baroness Frieda von Richthofen married an
Englishman named Ernest Weekley, a professor at the University of Nottingham, and soon settled into the role of the professor's wife. Weekley
treated her well, but she grew bored with their quiet life and his tepid lovemaking. On trips home to Germany she had a few love affairs, but this
wasn't what she wanted either, and so she returned to being faithful and
caring for their three children.
One day in 1912, a former student of Weekley's, David Herbert
Lawrence, paid a visit to the couple's house. A struggling writer, Lawrence
wanted the professor's professional advice. He was not home yet so Frieda
entertained him. She had never met such an intense young man. He talked
of his impoverished youth, his inability to understand women. And he listened attentively to her own complaints. He even scolded her for the bad
tea she had made him—somehow, even though she was a baroness, this excited her.
Lawrence returned for later visits, but now to see Frieda, not Weekley.
One day he confessed to her that he had fallen deeply in love with her. She
admitted to similar feelings, and proposed they find a trysting spot. Instead
Lawrence had a proposal of his own: Leave your husband tomorrow—leave
him for me. What about the children? Frieda asked. If the children are
more important than our love, Lawrence replied, then stay with them. But

patience with her: You are free to go back to them at any moment, he
would say, but if you stay, don't look back. He took her on an arduous
mountaineering trip in the Alps. A baroness, she had never experienced
such hardship, but Lawrence was firm: if two people are in love, why should
comfort matter?
In 1914, Frieda and Lawrence were married, but over the following
years the same pattern repeated. He would scold her for her laziness, the
nostalgia for her children, her abysmal housekeeping. He would take her
on trips around the world, on very little money, never letting her settle
down, although it was her fondest wish. They fought and fought. Once in
New Mexico, in front of friends, he yelled at her, "Take that dirty cigarette
out of your mouth! And stop sticking out that fat belly of yours!" "You'd
better stop that talk or I'll tell about your things," she yelled back. (She had
learned to give him a taste of his own medicine.) They both went outside.
Their friends watched, worried it might turn violent. They disappeared from
sight only to reappear moments later, arm in arm, laughing and mooning
over one another. That was the most disconcerting thing about the Lawrences: married for years, they often behaved like infatuated newlyweds.

That's the only way to

Interpretation. When Lawrence first met Frieda, he could sense right away
what her weakness was: she felt trapped, in a stultifying relationship and a
pampered life. Her husband, like so many husbands, was kind, but never
paid enough attention to her. She craved drama and adventure, but was too
lazy to get it on her own. Drama and adventure were just what Lawrence
would provide. Instead of feeling trapped, she had the freedom to leave
him at any moment. Instead of ignoring her, he criticized her constantly—
at least he was paying attention, never taking her for granted. Instead of
comfort and boredom, he gave her adventure and romance. The fights he
picked with ritualistic frequency also ensured nonstop drama and the space
for a powerful reconciliation. He inspired a touch of fear in her, which
kept her off balance, never quite sure of him. As a result, the relationship
never grew stale. It kept renewing itself.
If it is integration you are after, seduction must never stop. Otherwise
boredom will creep in. And the best way to keep the process going is often
to inject intermittent drama. This can be painful—opening old wounds,
stirring up jealousy, withdrawing a little. (Do not confuse this behavior
with nagging or carping criticism—this pain is strategic, designed to break
up rigid patterns.) On the other hand it can also be pleasant: think about

Beware the Aftereffects

proving yourself all over again, paying attention to nice little details, creating new temptations. In fact you should mix the two aspects, for too much
pain or pleasure will not prove seductive. You are not repeating the first seduction, for the target has already surrendered. You are simply supplying
little jolts, little wake-up calls that show two things: you have not stopped
trying, and they cannot take you for granted. The little jolt will stir up the
old poison, stoke the embers, bring you temporarily back to the beginning,
when your involvement had a most pleasant freshness and tension.
Remember: comfort and security are the death of seduction. A shared
journey with a little bit of hardship will do more to create a deep bond
than will expensive gifts and luxuries. The young are right to not care
about comfort in matters of love, and when you return to that sentiment, a
youthful spark will reignite.

5. In 1652, the famous French courtesan Ninon de l'Enclos met and fell in
love with the Marquis de Villarceaux. Ninon was a libertine; philosophy
and pleasure were more important to her than love. But the marquis inspired new sensations: he was so bold, so impetuous, that for once in her
life she let herself lose a little control. The marquis was possessive, a trait
she normally abhorred. But in him it seemed natural, almost charming: he
simply could not help himself. And so Ninon accepted his conditions:
there were to be no other men in her life. For her part she told him that she
would accept no money or gifts from him. This was to be about love, nothing else.
She rented a house opposite his in Paris, and they saw each other daily.
One afternoon the marquis suddenly burst in and accused her of having
another lover. His suspicions were unfounded, his accusations absurd, and
she told him so. This did not satisfy him, and he stormed out. The next day
Ninon received news that he had fallen quite ill. She was deeply concerned. As a desperate recourse, a sign of her love and submission, she decided to cut off her beautiful long hair, for which she was famous, and send
it to him. The gesture worked, the marquis recovered, and they resumed
their affair still more passionately. Friends and former lovers complained of
her sudden transformation into the devoted woman, but she did not care—
she was happy.
Now Ninon suggested that they go away together. The marquis, a married man, could not take her to his château, but a friend offered his own in
the country as a refuge for the lovers. Weeks became months, and their little stay turned into a prolonged honeymoon. Slowly, though, Ninon had
the feeling that something was wrong: the marquis was acting more like
a husband. Although he was as passionate as before, he seemed so confident, as if he had certain rights and privileges that no other man could
expect. The possessiveness that once had charmed her began to seem
oppressive. Nor did he stimulate her mind. She could get other men, and
equally handsome ones, to satisfy her physically without all that jealousy.

The Art of Seduction

Once this realization set in, Ninon wasted no time. She told the marquis that she was returning to Paris, and that it was over for good. He
begged and pleaded his case with much emotion—how could she be so
heartless? Although moved, Ninon was firm. Explanations would only
make it worse. She returned to Paris and resumed the life of a courtesan.
Her abrupt departure apparently shook up the marquis, but apparently not
too badly, for a few months later word reached her that he had fallen in love
with another woman.

Interpretation. A woman often spends months pondering the subtle
changes in her lover's behavior. She might complain or grow angry; she
might even blame herself. Under the weight of her complaints, the man
may change for a while, but an ugly dynamic and endless misunderstandings will ensue. What is the point of all of this? Once you are disenchanted
it is really too late. Ninon could have tried to figure out what had disenchanted her—the good looks that now bored her, the lack of mental stimulation, the feeling of being taken for granted. But why waste time figuring
it out? The spell was broken, so she moved on. She did not bother to explain, to worry about de Villarceaux's feelings, to make it all soft and easy
for him. She simply left. The person who seems so considerate of the
other, who tries to mend things or make excuses, is really just timid. Being
kind in such matters can be rather cruel. The marquis was able to blame
everything on his mistress's heartless, fickle nature. His vanity and pride intact, he could easily move on to another affair and put her behind him.
Not only does the long, lingering death of a relationship cause your
partner needless pain, it will have long-term consequences for you as well,
making you more skittish in the future, and weighing you down with guilt.
Never feel guilty, even if you were both the seducer and the one who now
feels disenchanted. It is not your fault. Nothing can last forever. You have
created pleasure for your victims, stirring them out of their rut. If you
make a clean quick break, in the long run they will appreciate it. The more
you apologize, the more you insult their pride, stirring up negative feelings
that will reverberate for years. Spare them the disingenuous explanations
that only complicate matters. The victim should be sacrificed, not tortured.

6. After fifteen years under the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte, the French
were exhausted. Too many wars, too much drama. When Napoleon was
defeated in 1814, and was imprisoned on the island of Elba, the French
were more than ready for peace and quiet. The Bourbons—the royal family
deposed by the revolution of 1789—returned to power. The king was
Louis XVIII; he was fat, boring, and pompous, but at least there would be
peace.
Then, in February of 1815, news reached France of Napoleon's dramatic escape from Elba, with seven small ships and a thousand men. He

Beware the Aftereffects

could head for America, start all over, but instead he was just crazy enough
to land at Cannes. What was he thinking? A thousand men against all the
armies of France? He set off toward Grenoble with his ragtag army. One at
least had to admire his courage, his insatiable love of glory and of France.
Then, too, the French peasantry were spellbound at the sight of their
former emperor. This man, after all, had redistributed a great deal of land
to them, which the new king was trying to take back. They swooned at the
sight of his famous eagle standards, revivals of symbols from the revolution.
They left their fields and joined his march. Outside Grenoble, the first of
the troops that the king sent to stop Napoleon caught up with him.
Napoleon dismounted and walked on foot toward them. "Soldiers of the
Fifth Army Corps!" he cried out. "Don't you know me? If there is one
among you who wishes to kill his emperor, let him come forward and do
so. Here I am!" He threw open his gray cloak, inviting them to take aim.
There was a moment of silence, and then, from all sides, cries rang out of
"Vive l'Empereur!" In one stroke, Napoleon's army had doubled in size.
The march continued. More soldiers, remembering the glory he had
given them, changed sides. The city of Lyons fell without a battle. Generals
with larger armies were dispatched to stop him, but the sight of Napoleon
at the head of his troops was an overwhelmingly emotional experience for
them, and they switched allegiance. King Louis fled France, abdicating in
the process. On March 20, Napoleon reentered Paris and returned to the
palace he had left only thirteen months before—all without having had to
fire a single shot.
The peasantry and the soldiers had embraced Napoleon, but Parisians
were less enthusiastic, particularly those who had served in his government.
They feared the storms he would bring. Napoleon ruled the country for
one hundred days, until the allies and his enemies from within defeated
him. This time he was shipped off to the remote island of St. Helena,
where he was to die.

Interpretation. Napoleon always thought of France, and his army, as a target to be wooed and seduced. As General de Ségur wrote of Napoleon: "In
moments of sublime power, he no longer commands like a man, but seduces like a woman." In the case of his escape from Elba, he planned a
bold, surprising gesture that would titillate a bored nation. He began his return to France among the people who would be most receptive to him: the
peasantry who had revered him. He revived the symbols—the revolutionary colors, the eagle standards—that would stir up the old sentiments. He
placed himself at the head of his army, daring his former soldiers to fire on
him. The march on Paris that brought him back to power was pure theater,
calculated for emotional effect every step of the way. What a contrast this
former amour presented to the dolt of a king who now ruled them.
Napoleon's second seduction of France was not a classical seduction,
following the usual steps, but a re-seduction. It was built on old emotions

•

and revived an old love. Once you have seduced a person (or a nation)
there is almost always a lull, a slight letdown, which sometimes leads to a
separation; it is surprisingly easy, though, to re-seduce the same target. The
old feelings never go away, they lie dormant, and in a flash you can take
your target by surprise.
It is a rare pleasure to be able to relive the past, and one's youth—to feel
the old emotions. Like Napoleon, add a dramatic flair to your re-seduction:
revive the old images, the symbols, the expressions that will stir memory.
Like the French, your targets will tend to forget the ugliness of the separation and will remember only the good things. You should make this second
seduction bold and quick, giving your targets no time to reflect or wonder.
Like Napoleon, play on the contrast to their current lover, making his or
her behavior seem timid and stodgy by comparison.
Not everyone will be receptive to a re-seduction, and some moments
will be inappropriate. When Napoleon came back from Elba, the Parisians
were too sophisticated for him, and could see right through him. Unlike
the peasants of the South, they already knew him well; and his reentry
came too soon, they were too worn out by him. If you want to re-seduce
someone, choose one who does not know you so well, whose memories of
you are cleaner, who is less suspicious by nature, and who is dissatisfied
with present circumstances. Also, you might want to let some time pass.
Time will restore your luster and make your faults fade away. Never see a
separation or sacrifice as final. With a little drama and planning, a victim
can be retaken in no time.

Symbol: Embers, the remains of the fire on the
morning after. Left to themselves, the embers will
slowly die out. Do not leave the fire to chance and to the
elements. To put it out, douse it, suffocate it, give it nothing to
feed on. To bring it back to life, fan it, stoke it, until it blazes
anew. Only your constant attention and vigilance will keep it burning.

T

o keep a person enchanted, you will have to re-seduce them constantly. But you can allow a little familiarity to creep in. The target
wants to feel that he or she is getting to know you. Too much mystery will
create doubt. It will also be tiring for you, who will have to sustain it. The
point is not to remain completely unfamiliar but rather, on occasion, to jolt
victims out of their complacency, surprising them as you surprised them in
the past. Do this right and they will have the delightful feeling that they are
constantly getting to know more about you—but never too much.

festival and play. You must make
your victims feel that being
with you gives them a different experience from
being in the real
world.

Festival Time and Place

C

enturies ago, life in most cultures was filled with work and routine.
But at certain moments in the year, this life was interrupted by festival. During these festivals—saturnalias of ancient Rome, the maypole festivals of Europe, the great potlatches of the Chinook Indians—work in the
fields or marketplace stopped. The entire tribe or town gathered in a sacred
space set apart for the festival. Temporarily relieved of duty and responsibility, people were granted license to run amok; they would wear masks or
costumes, which gave them other identities, sometimes those of powerful
figures reenacting the great myths of their culture. The festival was a
tremendous release from the burdens of daily life. It altered people's sense
of time, bringing moments in which they stepped outside of themselves.
Time seemed to stand still. Something like this experience can still be
found in the world's great surviving carnivals.
The festival represented a break in a person's daily life, a radically different experience from routine. On a more intimate level, that is how you
must envision your seductions. As the process advances, your targets experience a radical difference from daily life—a freedom from work or responsibility. Plunged into pleasure and play, they can act differently, can become
someone else, as if they were wearing a mask. The time you spend with
them is devoted to them and nothing else. Instead of the usual rotation of
work and rest, you are giving them grand, dramatic moments that stand
out. You bring them to places unlike the places they see in daily life—
heightened, theatrical places. Physical environment strongly affects people's
moods; a place dedicated to pleasure and play insinuates thoughts of pleasure and play. When your victims return to their duties and to the real
world, they feel the contrast strongly and they will start to crave that other
place into which you have drawn them. What you are essentially creating is
festival time and place, moments when the real world stops and fantasy
takes over. Our culture no longer supplies such experiences, and people
yearn for them. That is why almost everyone is waiting to be seduced and
why they will fall into your arms if you play this right.
The following are key components to reproducing festival time and place:

Create theatrical effects. Theater creates a sense of a separate, magical
world. The actors' makeup, the fake but alluring sets, the slightly unreal
433

434

•

Appendix A: Seductive Environment /Seductive Time

costumes—these heightened visuals, along with the story of the play, create
illusion. To produce this effect in real life, you must fashion your clothes,
makeup, and attitude to have a playful, artificial, edge—a feeling that you
have dressed for the pleasure of your audience. This is the goddesslike effect
of a Marlene Dietrich, or the fascinating effect of a dandy like Beau Brummel. Your encounters with your targets should also have a sense of drama,
achieved through the settings you choose and through your actions. The
target should not know what will happen next. Create suspense through
twists and turns that lead to the happy ending; you are performing. Whenever your targets meet you, they are returned to this vague feeling of being
in a play. You both have the thrill of wearing masks, of playing a different
role from the one your life has allotted you.

Use the visual language of pleasure. Certain kinds of visual stimuli signal
that you are not in the real world. You want to avoid images that have
depth, which might provoke thought, or guilt; instead, you should work in
environments that are all surface, full of glittering objects, mirrors, pools of
water, a constant play of light. The sensory overload of these spaces creates
an intoxicating, buoyant feeling. The more artificial, the better. Show your
targets a playful world, full of the sights and sounds that excite the baby or
child within them. Luxury—the sense that money has been spent or even
wasted—adds to the feeling that the real world of duty and morality has
been banished. Call it the brothel effect.

Keep it crowded or close. People crowding together raise the psychological temperature to hothouse levels. Festivals and carnivals depend on the
contagious feeling a crowd creates. Bring your target to such environments
sometimes, to lower their normal defensiveness. Similarly, any kind of
situation that brings people together in a small space for a long period of
time is extremely conducive to seduction. For years, Sigmund Freud had a
small, tight-knit stable of disciples who attended his private lectures and
who engaged in an astonishing number of love affairs. Either lead the seduced into a crowded, festivallike environment or go trolling for targets in a
closed world.

Manufacture mystical effects. Spiritual or mystical effects distract people's
minds from reality, making them feel elevated and euphoric. From here it
is but a small step to physical pleasure. Use whatever props are at hand—
astrology books, angelic imagery, mystical-sounding music from some faroff culture. The great eighteenth-century Austrian charlatan Franz Mesmer
filled his salons with harp music, the perfume of exotic incense, and a female voice singing in a distant room. On the walls he put stained glass and

Appendix A: Seductive

Environment/Seductive

mirrors. His dupes would feel relaxed, uplifted, and as they sat in the room
where he used magnets for their healing powers, they would feel a kind of
spiritual tingling pass from body to body. Anything vaguely mystical helps
block out the real world, and it is easy to move from the spiritual to the
sexual.

Distort their sense of time—speed and youth. Festival time has a kind of
speed and frenzy that make people feel more alive. Seduction should make
the heart beat faster, so that the seduced loses track of time passing. Take
them to places of constant activity and movement. Embark with them on
some kind of journey together, distracting their minds with new sights.
Youth may fade and disappear, but seduction brings the feeling of being
young, no matter the age of those involved. And youth is mostly energy.
The pace of the seduction must pick up at a certain moment, creating
a whirling effect in the mind. It is no wonder that Casanova did much of
his seducing at balls, or that the waltz was the preferred tool of many a
nineteenth-century rake.

Create moments. Everyday life is a drudgery in which the same actions
endlessly repeat. The festival, on the other hand, we remember as a moment when everything was transformed—when a little bit of eternity and
myth entered our lives. Your seduction must have such peaks, moments
when something dramatic happens and time is experienced differently.
You must give your targets such moments, whether by staging the seduction in a place—a carnival, a theater—where they naturally occur or by
creating them yourself, with dramatic actions that stir up strong emotions. Those moments should be pure leisure and pleasure—no thoughts
of work or morality can intrude. Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of
King Louis XV, had to re-seduce her easily bored lover every few months;
intensely creative, she devised parties, balls, games, a little theater at Versailles. The seduced revels in affairs like this, sensing the effort you have expended to divert and enchant them.

Scenes from Seductive Time and Place
1. Around the year 1710, a young man whose father was a prosperous
wine dealer in Osaka, Japan, found himself daydreaming more and more.
He worked night and day for his father, and the burden of family life and
all of its duties was oppressive. Like every young man, he had heard of the
pleasure districts of the city—the quarters where the normally strict laws of
the shogunate could be violated. It was here that you would find the ukiyo,
the "floating world" of transient pleasures, a place where actors and courte-

sans ruled. This was what the young man was daydreaming about. Biding
his time, he managed to find an evening when he could slip out unnoticed.
He headed straight for the pleasure quarters.
This was a cluster of buildings—restaurants, exclusive clubs, teahouses—that stood out from the rest of the city by their magnificence and
color. The moment the young man stepped into it, he knew he was in
a different world. Actors wandered the streets in elaborately dyed kimonos.
They had such manners and attitudes, as if they were still on stage. The
streets bustled with energy; the pace was fast. Bright lanterns stood out
against the night, as did the colorful posters for the nearby kabuki theater.
The women had a completely different air about them. They stared at him
brazenly, acting with the freedom of a man. He caught sight of an onnagata,
one of the men who played female roles in the theater—a man more beautiful than most women he had seen and whom the passersby treated like
royalty.
The young man saw other young men like himself entering a teahouse,
so he followed them in. Here the highest class of courtesans, the great
tayus, plied their trade. A few minutes after the young man sat down, he
heard a noise and bustle, and down the stairs came a few of the tayus, followed by musicians and jesters. The women's eyebrows were shaved, replaced by a thick black painted line. Their hair was swept up in a perfect
fold, and he had never seen such beautiful kimonos. The tayus seemed to
float across the floor, using different kinds of steps (suggestive, creeping,
cautious, etc.), depending on whom they were approaching and what they
wanted to communicate to him. They ignored the young man; he had no
idea how to invite them over, but he noticed that some of the older men
had a way of bantering with them that was a language all its own. The
wine began to flow, music was played, and finally some lower-level courtesans came in. By then the young man's tongue was loosened. These courtesans
were much friendlier and the young man began to lose all track of time.
Later he managed to stagger home, and only the next morning did he realize how much money he had spent. If father ever found out . . .
Yet a few weeks later he was back. Like hundreds of such sons in Japan
whose stories filled the literature of the period, he was on the path toward
squandering his father's wealth on the "floating world."
Seduction is another world into which you initiate your victims. Like the
ukiyo, it depends on a strict separation from the day-to-day world. When
your victims are in your presence, the outside world—with its morality, its
codes, its responsibilities—is banished. Anything is allowed, particularly
anything normally repressed. The conversation is lighter and more suggestive. Clothes and places have a touch of theatricality. The license exists to
act differently, to be someone else, without any heaviness or judging. It is a
kind of concentrated psychological "floating world" that you create for the
others, and it becomes addictive. When they leave you and return to their
routines, they are doubly aware of what they are missing. The moment

Appendix A:

Seductive

Environment/Seductive

they crave the atmosphere you have created, the seduction is complete. As
in the floating world, money is to be wasted. Generosity and luxury go
hand in hand with a seductive environment.

2. It began in the early 1960s: people would come to Andy Warhol's New
York studio, soak up the atmosphere, and stay awhile. Then in 1963, the
artist moved into a new Manhattan space and a member of his entourage
covered some of the walls and pillars in tin foil and spray-painted a brick
wall and other things silver. A red quilted couch in the center, some fivefoot-high plastic candy bars, a turntable that glittered with tiny mirrors, and
helium-filled silver pillows that floated in the air completed the set. Now
the L-shaped space became known as The Factory, and a scene began to
develop. More and more people started showing up—why not just leave
the door open, Andy reasoned, and come what may. During the day, while
Andy would work on his paintings and films, people would gather—actors,
hustlers, drug dealers, other artists. And the elevator would keep groaning
all night as the beautiful people began to make the place their home. Here
might be Montgomery Clift, nursing a drink by himself; over there, a
beautiful young socialite chatting with a drag queen and a museum curator.
They kept pouring in, all of them young and glamorously dressed. It was
like one of those children's shows on TV, Andy once said to a friend, where
guests keep dropping in on the endless party and there's always some new
bit of entertainment. And that was indeed what it seemed like—with nothing serious happening, just lots of talk and flirting and flashbulbs popping
and endless posing, as if everyone were in a film. The museum curator
would begin to giggle like a teenager and the socialite would flounce about
like a hooker.
By midnight everyone would be packed together. You could hardly
move. The band would arrive, the light show would begin, and it would all
careen in a new direction, wilder and wilder. Somehow the crowd would
disperse at some point, then in the afternoon it would all start up again
as the entourage trickled back. Hardly anyone went to The Factory just
once.
It is oppressive always to have to act the same way, playing the same boring
role that work or duty imposes on you. People yearn for a place or a moment when they can wear a mask, act differently, be someone else. That is
why we glorify actors: they have the freedom and playfulness in relation to
their own ego that we would love to have. Any environment that offers a
chance to play a different role, to be an actor, is immensely seductive. It can
be an environment that you create, like The Factory. Or a place where you
take your target. In such environments you simply cannot be defensive; the
playful atmosphere, the sense that anything is allowed (except seriousness),
dispels any kind of reactiveness. Being in such a place becomes a drug. To
re-create the effect, remember Warhol's metaphor of the children's TV

show. Keep everything light and playful, full of distractions, noise, color,
and a bit of chaos. No weight, responsibilities, or judgments. A place to
lose yourself in.

3. In 1746, a seventeen-year-old girl named Cristina had come to the city
of Venice, Italy, with her uncle, a priest, in search of a husband. Cristina
was from a small village but had a substantial dowry to offer. The Venetian
men who were willing to marry her, however, did not please her. So after
two weeks of futile searching, she and her uncle prepared to return to their
village. They were seated in their gondola, about to leave the city, when
Cristina saw an elegantly dressed young man walking toward them.
"There's a handsome fellow!" she said to her uncle. "I wish he was in the
boat with us." The gentleman could not have heard this, yet he approached,
handed the gondolier some money, and sat down beside Cristina, much to
her delight. He introduced himself as Jacques Casanova. When the priest
complimented him on his friendly manners, Casanova replied, "Perhaps I
should not have been so friendly, my reverend father, if I had not been attracted by the beauty of your niece."
Cristina told him why they had come to Venice and why they were
leaving. Casanova laughed and chided her—a man cannot decide to marry
a girl after seeing her for a few days. He must know more about her character; it would take at least six months. He himself was looking for a wife,
and he explained to her why he had been as disappointed by the girls he
had met as she had been disappointed by the men. Casanova seemed to
have no destination; he simply accompanied them, entertaining Cristina
the whole way with witty conversation. When the gondola arrived at the
edge of Venice, Casanova hired a carriage to the nearby city of Treviso and
invited them to join him. From there they could catch a chaise to their village. The uncle accepted, and on the way to their carriage, Casanova offered his arm to Cristina. What would his mistress say if she saw them, she
asked. "I have no mistress," he answered, "and I shall never have one again,
for I shall never find such a pretty girl as you—no, not in Venice." His
words went to her head, filling it with all kinds of strange thoughts, and she
began to talk and act in a manner that was new to her, becoming almost
brazen. What a pity she could not stay in Venice for the six months he
needed to get to know a girl, she told Casanova. Without hesitation he offered to pay her expenses in Venice for that period while he courted her.
On the carriage ride she turned this offer over in her mind, and once in
Treviso she got her uncle alone and begged him to return to the village by
himself, then come back for her in a few days. She was in love with
Casanova; she wanted to know him better; he was a perfect gentleman,
who could be trusted. The uncle agreed to do as she wished.
The following day Casanova never left her side. There was not the
slightest hint of disagreement in his nature. They spent the day wandering
around the city, shopping and talking. He took her to a play in the evening

Appendix A: Seductive

Environment/Seductive

and to the casino after that, supplying her with a domino and a mask. He
gave her money to gamble and she won. By the time the uncle returned to
Treviso, she had all but forgotten about her marriage plans—all she could
think of was the six months she would spend with Casanova. But she returned to her village with her uncle and waited for Casanova to visit her.
He showed up a few weeks later, bringing with him a handsome young
man named Charles. Alone with Cristina, Casanova explained the situation: Charles was the most eligible bachelor in Venice, a man who would
make a much better husband than he would. Cristina admitted to Casanova
that she too had had her doubts. He was too exciting, had made her think
of other things besides marriage, things she was ashamed of. Perhaps it was
for the better. She thanked him for taking such pains to find her a husband.
Over the next few days Charles courted her, and they were married several
weeks later. The fantasy and allure of Casanova, however, remained in her
mind forever.
Casanova could not marry—it was against everything in his nature. But it
was also against his nature to force himself on a young girl. Better to leave
her with the perfect fantasy image than to ruin her life. Besides, he enjoyed
the courting and flirting more than anything else.
Casanova supplied a young woman with the ultimate fantasy. While he
was in her orbit he devoted every moment to her. He never mentioned
work, allowing no boring, mundane details to interrupt the fantasy. And he
added great theater. He wore the most spectacular outfits, full of sparkling
jewels. He led her to the most wonderful entertainments—carnivals,
masked balls, the casinos, journeys with no destination. He was the great
master at creating seductive time and environment.
Casanova is the model to aspire to. While in your presence your targets
must sense a change. Time has a different rhythm—they barely notice its
passing. They have the feeling that everything is stopping for them, just as
all normal activity comes to a halt at a festival. The idle pleasures you provide them are contagious—one leads to another and to another, until it is
too late to turn back.

Appendix B
Soft Seduction: How to Sell
Anything to the Masses

The less you seem to be
selling something—including yourself—the better. By being too obvious in your pitch, you will raise suspicion; you will also bore
your audience, an unforgivable sin. Instead, make your approach soft, seductive, and
insidious. Soft: be indirect. Create news and events for the media to pick up, spreading your
name in a way that seems spontaneous, not hard or calculated. Seductive: keep it entertaining.
Your name and image are bathed in positive associations; you are selling pleasure and promise. Insidious: aim at the unconscious, using images that linger in the mind, placing
your message in the visuals. Frame what you are selling as part of a new
trend, and it will become one. It is almost impossible to
resist the soft seduction.

The Soft Sell
eduction is the ultimate form of power. Those who give in to it do so
willingly and happily. There is rarely any resentment on their part; they
forgive you any kind of manipulation because you have brought them pleasure, a rare commodity in the world. With such power at your fingertips,
though, why stop at the conquest of a man or woman? A crowd, an electorate, a nation can be brought under your sway simply by applying on a
mass level the tactics that work so well on an individual. The only difference is the goal—not sex but influence, a vote, people's attention—and the
degree of tension. When you are after sex, you deliberately create anxiety, a
touch of pain, twists, and turns. Seduction on the mass level is more diffuse
and soft. Creating a constant titillation, you fascinate the masses with what
you are offering. They pay attention to you because it is pleasant to do so.
Let us say your goal is to sell yourself—as a personality, a trendsetter, a
candidate for office. There are two ways to go: the hard sell (the direct approach) and the soft sell (the indirect approach). In the hard sell you state
your case strongly and directly, explaining why your talents, your ideas,
your political message are superior to anyone else's. You tout your achievements, quote statistics, bring in expert opinions, even go so far as to induce
a bit of fear if the audience ignores your message. The approach is a tad aggressive and might have unwanted consequences: some people will be offended, resisting your message, even if what you say is true. Others will feel
you are manipulating them—who can trust experts and statistics, and why
are you trying so hard? You will also grate on people's nerves, becoming
unpleasant to listen to. In a world in which you cannot succeed without
selling to large numbers, the direct approach won't take you far.
The soft sell, on the other hand, has the potential to draw in millions
because it is entertaining, gentle on the ears, and can be repeated without irritating people. The technique was invented by the great charlatans
of seventeenth-century Europe. To peddle their elixirs and alchemic
concoctions, they would first put on a show—clowns, music, vaudevilletype routines—that had nothing to do with what they were selling. A
crowd would form, and as the audience laughed and relaxed, the charlatan
would come onstage and briefly and dramatically discuss the miraculous effects of the elixir. By honing this technique, the charlatans discovered that
instead of selling a few dozen bottles of the dubious medicine, they were
suddenly selling scores or even hundreds.

In the centuries since, publicists, advertisers, political strategists, and
others have taken this method to new heights, but the rudiments of the soft
sell remain the same. First bring pleasure by creating a positive atmosphere
around your name or message. Induce a warm, relaxed feeling. Never seem
to be selling something—that will look manipulative and suspicious. Instead, let entertainment value and good feelings take center stage, sneaking
the sale through the side door. And in that sale, you do not seem to be selling yourself or a particular idea or candidate; you are selling a life-style, a
good mood, a sense of adventure, a feeling of hipness, or a neatly packaged
rebellion.
Here are some of the key components of the soft sell.

Appear as news, never as publicity. First impressions are critical. If
your audience first sees you in the context of an advertisement or publicity
item, you instantly join the mass of other advertisements screaming for
attention—and everyone knows that advertisements are artful manipulations, a kind of deception. So, for your first appearance in the public eye,
manufacture an event, some kind of attention-getting situation that the
media will "inadvertently" pick up as if it were news. People pay more attention to what is broadcast as news—it seems more real. You suddenly
stand out from everything else, if only for a moment—but that moment
has more credibility than hours of advertising time. The key is to orchestrate the details thoroughly, creating a story with dramatic impact and
movement, tension and resolution. The media will cover it for days. Conceal your real purpose—to sell yourself—at any cost.

Stir basic emotions. Never promote your message through a rational, direct argument. That will take effort on your audience's part and will not
gain its attention. Aim for the heart, not the head. Design your words and
images to stir basic emotions—lust, patriotism, family values. It is easier to
gain and hold people's attention once you have made them think of their
family, their children, their future. They feel stirred, uplifted. Now you
have their attention and the space to insinuate your true message. Days later
the audience will remember your name, and remembering your name is
half the game. Similarly, find ways to surround yourself with emotional
magnets—war heroes, children, saints, small animals, whatever it takes.
Make your appearance bring these emotionally positive associations to
mind, giving you extra presence. Never let these associations be defined or
created for you, and never leave them to chance.

Make the medium the message. Pay more attention to the form of your
message than to the content. Images are more seductive than words, and visuals—soothing colors, appropriate backdrop, the suggestion of speed

Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses

or movement—should actually be your real message. The audience may
focus superficially on the content or moral you are preaching, but they are
really absorbing the visuals, which get under their skin and stay there longer
than any words or preachy pronouncements. Your visuals should have a
hypnotic effect. They should make people feel happy or sad, depending on
what you want to accomplish. And the more they are distracted by visual
cues, the harder it will be for them to think straight or see through your
manipulations.

Speak the target's language—be chummy. At all costs, avoid appearing
superior to your audience. Any hint of smugness, the use of complicated
words or ideas, quoting too many statistics—all that is fatal. Instead, make
yourself seem equal to your targets and on intimate terms with them. You
understand them, you share their spirit, their language. If people are cynical
about the manipulations of advertisers and politicians, exploit their cynicism for your own purposes. Portray yourself as one of the folk, warts and
all. Show that you share your audience's skepticism by revealing the tricks
of the trade. Make your publicity as down-home and minimal as possible,
so that your competitors look sophisticated and snobby in comparison.
Your selective honesty and strategic weakness will get people to trust you.
You are the audience's friend, an intimate. Enter their spirit and they will
relax and listen to you.

Start a chain reaction—everyone is doing it. People who seem to be desired by others are immediately more seductive to their targets. Apply this
to the soft seduction. You need to act as if you have already excited crowds
of people; your behavior will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Seem to be
in the vanguard of a trend or life-style and the public will lap you up for
fear of being left behind. Spread your image, with a logo, slogans, posters,
so that it appears everywhere. Announce your message as a trend and it will
become one. The goal is to create a kind of viral effect in which more and
more people become infected with the desire to have whatever you are offering. This is the easiest and most seductive way to sell.

Tell people who they are. It is always unwise to engage an individual or
the public in any kind of argument. They will resist you. Instead of trying
to change people's ideas, try to change their identity, their perception of
reality, and you will have far more control of them in the long run. Tell
them who they are, create an image, an identity that they will want to assume. Make them dissatisfied with their current status. Making them unhappy with themselves gives you room to suggest a new life-style, a new
identity. Only by listening to you can they find out who they are. At the
same time, you want to change their perception of the world outside them

•

445

446

•

Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses

by controlling what they look at. Use as many media as possible to create a
kind of total environment for their perceptions. Your image should be seen
not as an advertisement but as part of the atmosphere.

Some Soft Seductions
1. Andrew Jackson was a true American hero. In 1814, in the Battle of
New Orleans, he led a ragtag band of American soldiers against a superior
English army and won. He also conquered Indians in Florida. Jackson's
army loved him for his rough-hewn ways: he fed on acorns when there was
nothing else to eat, he slept on a hard bed, he drank hard cider, just like his
men. Then, after he lost or was cheated out of the presidential election of
1824 (in fact he won the popular vote, but so narrowly that the election
was thrown into the House of Representatives, which chose John Quincy
Adams, after much deal making), he retired to his farm in Tennessee, where
he lived the simple life, tilling the soil, reading the Bible, staying far from
the corruptions of Washington. Where Adams had gone to Harvard, played
billiards, drunk soda water, and relished European finery, Jackson, like
many Americans of the time, had been raised in a log cabin. He was an uneducated man, a man of the earth.
This, at any rate, was what Americans read in their newspapers in the
months after the controversial 1824 election. Spurred on by these articles,
people in taverns and halls across the country began talking of how the war
hero Andrew Jackson had been wronged, how an insidious aristocratic elite
was conspiring to take over the country. So when Jackson declared that he
would run again against Adams in the presidential election of 1828—but
this time as the leader of a new organization, the Democratic Party—the
public was thrilled. Jackson was the first major political figure to have a
nickname, Old Hickory, and soon Hickory clubs were sprouting up in
America's towns and cities. Their meetings resembled spiritual revivals. The
hot-button issues of the day were discussed (tariffs, the abolition of slavery), and club members felt certain that Jackson was on their side. It was
hard to know for sure—he was a little vague on the issues—but this election was about something larger than issues: it was about restoring democracy and restoring basic American values to the White House.
Soon the Hickory clubs were sponsoring events like town barbecues,
the planting of hickory trees, dances around a hickory pole. They organized lavish public feasts, always including large quantities of liquor. In the
cities there were parades, and these were stirring events. They often took
place at night so that urbanites would witness a procession of Jackson supporters holding torches. Others would carry colorful banners with portraits
of Jackson or caricatures of Adams and slogans ridiculing his decadent
ways. And everywhere there was hickory—hickory sticks, hickory brooms,
hickory canes, hickory leaves in people's hats. Men on horseback would

Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses

ride through the crowd, spurring people into "huzzahs!" for Jackson. Others would lead the crowd in songs about Old Hickory.
The Democrats, for the first time in an election, conducted opinion
polls, finding out what the common man thought about the candidates.
These polls were published in the papers, and the overwhelming conclusion was that Jackson was ahead. Yes, a new movement was sweeping the
country. It all came to a head when Jackson made a personal appearance in
New Orleans as part of a celebration commemorating the battle he had
fought so bravely there fourteen years earlier. This was unprecedented: no
presidential candidate had ever campaigned in person before, and in fact
such an appearance would have been considered improper. But Jackson
was a new kind of politician, a true man of the people. Besides, he insisted
that his purpose for the visit was patriotism, not politics. The spectacle
was unforgettable—Jackson entering New Orleans on a steamboat as the
fog lifted, cannon fire ringing out from all sides, grand speeches, endless
feasts, a kind of mass delirium taking over the city. One man said it was
"like a dream. The world has never witnessed so glorious, so wonderful a
celebration—never have gratitude and patriotism so happily united."
This time the will of the people prevailed. Jackson was elected president.
And it was not one region that brought him victory: New Englanders,
Southerners, Westerners, merchants, farmers, and workers were all infected
with the Jackson fever.

Interpretation. After the debacle of 1824, Jackson and his supporters were
determined to do things differently in 1828. America was becoming more
diverse, developing populations of immigrants, Westerners, urban laborers,
and so on. To win a mandate Jackson would have to overcome new regional and class differences. One of the first and most important steps his
supporters took was to found newspapers all around the country. While he
himself seemed to have retired from public life, these papers promulgated
an image of him as the wronged war hero, the victimized man of the people. In truth, Jackson was wealthy, as were all of his major backers. He
owned one of the largest plantations in Tennessee, and he owned many
slaves. He drank more fine liquor than hard cider and slept on a soft bed
with European linens. And while he might have been uneducated, he was
extremely shrewd, with a shrewdness built on years of army combat.
The image of the man of the earth disguised all this, and, once it was
established, it could be contrasted with the aristocratic image of Adams. In
this way Jackson's strategists covered up his political inexperience and made
the election turn on questions of character and values. Instead of political issues they raised trivial matters like drinking habits and church attendance. To keep up the enthusiasm they staged spectacles that seemed to
be spontaneous celebrations but in fact were carefully choreographed. The
support for Jackson seemed to be a movement, as evidenced (and advanced)

•

447

448

•

Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses

by the opinion polls. The event in New Orleans—hardly nonpolitical, and
Louisiana was a swing state—bathed Jackson in an aura of patriotic, quasireligious grandeur.
Society has fractured into smaller and smaller units. Communities are
less cohesive; even individuals feel more inner conflict. To win an election
or to sell anything in large numbers, you have to paper over these differences somehow—you have to unify the masses. The only way to accomplish this is to create an inclusive image, one that attracts and excites people
on a basic, almost unconscious level. You are not talking about the truth, or
about reality; you are forging a myth.
Myths create identification. Build a myth about yourself and the common people will identify with your character, your plight, your aspirations,
just as you identify with theirs. This image should include your flaws, highlight the fact that you are not the best orator, the most educated man, the
smoothest politician. Seeming human and down to earth disguises the
manufactured quality of your image. To sell this image you need to have
the proper vagueness. It is not that you avoid talk of issues and details—that
will make you seem insubstantial—but that all your talk of issues is framed
within the softer context of character, values, and vision. You want to
lower taxes, say, because it will help families—and you are a family person.
You must not only be inspiring but also entertaining—that is a popular,
friendly touch. This strategy will infuriate your opponents, who will try to
unmask you, reveal the truth behind the myth; but that will only make
them seem smug, overserious, defensive, and snobbish. That now becomes
part of their image, and it will help sink them.

2. On Easter Sunday, March 31, 1929, New York churchgoers began to
pour onto Fifth Avenue after the morning service for the annual Easter parade. The streets were blocked off, and as had been the custom for years,
people were wearing their finest outfits, women in particular showing off
the latest in spring fashions. But this year the promenaders on Fifth Avenue
noticed something else. Two young women were coming down the steps of
Saint Thomas's Church. At the bottom they reached into their purses, took
out cigarettes—Lucky Strikes—and lit up. Then they walked down the
avenue with their escorts, laughing and puffing away. A buzz went through
the crowd. Women had only recently begun smoking cigarettes, and it was
considered improper for a lady to be seen smoking in the street. Only a
certain kind of woman would do that. These two, however, were elegant
and fashionable. People watched them intently, and were further astounded
several minutes later when they reached the next church along the avenue.
Here two more young ladies—equally elegant and well bred—left the
church, approached the two holding cigarettes, and, as if suddenly inspired
to join them, pulled out Lucky Strikes of their own and asked for a light.
Now the four women were marching together down the avenue. They
were steadily joined by more, and soon ten young women were holding

Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses • 449

cigarettes in public, as if nothing were more natural. Photographers appeared and took pictures of this novel sight. Usually at the Easter parade,
people would have been whispering about a new hat style or the new
spring color. This year everyone was talking about the daring young
women and their cigarettes. The next day, photographs and articles appeared in the papers about them. A United Press dispatch read, "Just as
Miss Federica Freylinghusen, conspicuous in a tailored outfit of dark grey,
pushed her way thru the jam in front of St. Patrick's, Miss Bertha Hunt and
six colleagues struck another blow in behalf of the liberty of women.
Down Fifth Avenue they strolled, puffing at cigarettes. Miss Hunt issued
the following communique from the smoke-clouded battlefield: 'I hope
that we have started something and that these torches of freedom, with no
particular brand favored, will smash the discriminatory taboo on cigarettes
for women and that our sex will go on breaking down all discriminations.' "
The story was picked up by newspapers around the country, and soon
women in other cities began to light up in the streets. The controversy
raged for weeks, some papers decrying this new habit, others coming to the
women's defense. A few months later, though, public smoking by women
had become a socially acceptable practice. Few people bothered to protest
it anymore.

Interpretation. In January 1929, several New York debutantes received the
same telegram from a Miss Bertha Hunt: "In the interests of equality of the
sexes . . . I and other young women will light another torch of freedom by
smoking cigarettes while strolling on Fifth Avenue Easter Sunday." The
debutantes who ended up participating met beforehand in the office where
Hunt worked as a secretary. They planned what churches to appear at, how
to link up with each other, all the details. Hunt handed out packs of Lucky
Strikes. Everything worked to perfection on the appointed day.
Little did the debutantes know, though, that the whole affair had been
masterminded by a man—Miss Hunt's boss, Edward Bernays, a public relations adviser to the American Tobacco Company, makers of Lucky Strike.
American Tobacco had been luring women into smoking with all kinds of
clever ads, but the consumption was limited by the fact that smoking in the
street was considered unladylike. The head of American Tobacco had asked
Bernays for his help and Mr. Bernays had obliged him by applying a technique that was to become his trademark: gain public attention by creating
an event that the media would cover as news. Orchestrate every detail but
make them seem spontaneous. As more people heard of this "event," it
would spark imitative behavior—in this case more women smoking in the
streets.
Bernays, a nephew of Sigmund Freud and perhaps the greatest public
relations genius of the twentieth century, understood a fundamental law of
any kind of sell. The moment the targets know you are after something—a
vote, a sale—they become resistant. But disguise your sales pitch as a news

450

•

Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses

event and not only will you bypass their resistance, you can also create a social trend that does the selling for you. To make this work, the event you set
up must stand out from all the other events that are covered by the media,
yet it cannot stand out too far or it will seem contrived. In the case of the
Easter parade, Bernays (through Bertha Hunt) chose women who would
seem elegant and proper even with their cigarettes in their hands. Yet in
breaking a social taboo, and doing so as a group, such women would create
an image so dramatic and startling that the media would be unable to pass it
up. An event that is picked up by the news has the imprimatur of reality.
It is important to give this manufactured event positive associations, as
Bernays did in creating a feeling of rebellion, of women banding together.
Associations that are patriotic, say, or subtly sexual, or spiritual—anything
pleasant and seductive—take on a life of their own. Who can resist? People
essentially persuade themselves to join the crowd without even realizing
that a sale has taken place. The feeling of active participation is vital to seduction. No one wants to feel left out of a growing movement.

3. In the presidential campaign of 1984, President Ronald Reagan, running for reelection, told the public, "It's morning again in America." His
presidency, he claimed, had restored American pride. The recent, successful
Olympics in Los Angeles were symbolic of the country's return to strength
and confidence. Who could possibly want to turn the clock back to 1980,
which Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter, had termed a time of malaise?
Reagan's Democratic challenger, Walter Mondale, thought Americans
had had enough of the Reagan soft touch. They were ready for honesty,
and that would be Mondale's appeal. Before a nationwide television audience, Mondale declared, "Let's tell the truth. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes,
and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did." He repeated this straightforward approach on numerous occasions. By October his poll numbers had
plunged to all-time lows.
The CBS News reporter Lesley Stahl had been covering the campaign,
and as Election Day neared, she had an uneasy feeling. It wasn't so much
that Reagan had focused on emotions and moods rather than hard issues. It
was more that the media was giving him a free ride; he and his election
team, she felt, were playing the press like a fiddle. They always managed to
get him photographed in the perfect setting, looking strong and presidential. They fed the press snappy headlines along with dramatic footage of
Reagan in action. They were putting on a great show.
Stahl decided to assemble a news piece that would show the public how
Reagan used television to cover up the negative effects of his policies. The
piece began with a montage of images that his team had orchestrated over
the years: Reagan relaxing on his ranch in jeans; standing tall at the Normandy invasion tribute in France; throwing a football with his Secret Service bodyguards; sitting in an inner-city classroom. . . . Over these images
Stahl asked, "How does Ronald Reagan use television? Brilliantly. He's

Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses

been criticized as the rich man's president, but the TV pictures say it isn't
so. At seventy-three, Mr. Reagan could have an age problem. But the TV
pictures say it isn't so. Americans want to feel proud of their country again,
and of their president. And the TV pictures say you can. The orchestration
of television coverage absorbs the White House. Their goal? To emphasize
the president's greatest asset, which, his aides say, is his personality. They
provide pictures of him looking like a leader. Confident, with his Marlboro
man walk."
Over images of Reagan shaking hands with handicapped athletes in
wheelchairs and cutting the ribbon at a new facility for seniors, Stahl continued, "They also aim to erase the negatives. Mr. Reagan tried to counter
the memory of an unpopular issue with a carefully chosen backdrop that
actually contradicts the president's policy. Look at the handicapped Olympics, or the opening ceremony of an old-age home. No hint that he tried
to cut the budgets for the disabled and for federally subsidized housing for
the elderly." On and on went the piece, showing the gap between the feelgood images that played on the screen and the reality of Reagan's actions.
"President Reagan," Stahl concluded, "is accused of running a campaign in
which he highlights the images and hides from the issues. But there's no
evidence that the charges will hurt him because when people see the president on television, he makes them feel good, about America, about themselves, and about him."
Stahl depended on the good will of the Reagan people in covering the
White House, but her piece was strongly negative, so she braced herself for
trouble. Yet a senior White House official telephoned her that evening:
"Great piece," he said. "What?" asked a stunned Stahl. "Great piece," he repeated. "Did you listen to what I said?" she asked. "Lesley, when you're
showing four and a half minutes of great pictures of Ronald Reagan, no
one listens to what you say. Don't you know that the pictures are overriding
your message because they conflict with your message? The public sees
those pictures and they block your message. They didn't even hear what
you said. So, in our minds, it was a four-and-a-half-minute free ad for the
Ronald Reagan campaign for reelection."

Interpretation. Most of the men who worked on communications for
Reagan had a background in marketing. They knew the importance of
telling a story crisply, sharply, and with good visuals. Each morning they
went over what the headline of the day should be, and how they could
shape this into a short visual piece, getting the president into a video opportunity. They paid detailed attention to the backdrop behind the president in the Oval Office, to the way the camera framed him when he was
with other world leaders, and to having him filmed in motion, with his
confident walk. The visuals carried the message better than any words
could do. As one Reagan official said, "What are you going to believe, the
facts or your eyes?"

Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses

Free yourself from the need to communicate in the normal direct manner and you will present yourself with greater opportunities for the soft
sell. Make the words you say unobtrusive, vague, alluring. And pay much
greater attention to your style, the visuals, the story they tell. Convey a
sense of movement and progress by showing yourself in motion. Express
confidence not through facts and figures but through colors and positive
imagery, appealing to the infant in everyone. Let the media cover you unguided and you are at their mercy. So turn the dynamic around—the press
needs drama and visuals? Provide them. It is fine to discuss issues or "truth"
as long as you package it entertainingly. Remember: images linger in the
mind long after words are forgotten. Do not preach to the public—that
never works. Learn to express your message through visuals that insinuate
positive emotions and happy feelings.

4. In 1919, the movie press agent Harry Reichenbach was asked to do advance publicity for a picture called The Virgin of Stamboul. It was the usual
romantic potboiler in an exotic locale, and normally a publicist would
mount a campaign with alluring posters and advertisements. But Harry
never operated the usual way. He had begun his career as a carnival barker,
and there the only way to get the public into your tent was to stand out
from the other barkers. So Harry dug up eight scruffy Turks whom he
found living in Manhattan, dressed them up in costumes (flowing sea-green
trousers, gold-crescented turbans) provided by the movie studio, rehearsed
them in every line and gesture, and checked them into an expensive hotel.
Word quickly spread to the newspapers (with a little help from Harry) that
a delegation of Turks had arrived in New York on a secret diplomatic
mission.
Reporters converged on the hotel. Since his appearance in New York
was clearly no longer a secret, the head of the mission, "Sheikh Ali Ben
Mohammed," invited them up to his suite. The newspapermen were impressed by the Turks' colorful outfits, salaams, and rituals. The sheikh then
explained why he had come to New York. A beautiful young woman
named Sari, known as the Virgin of Stamboul, had been betrothed to the
sheikh's brother. An American soldier passing through had fallen in love
with her and had managed to steal her from her home and take her to
America. Her mother had died from grief. The sheikh had found out she
was in New York, and had come to bring her back.
Mesmerized by the sheikh's colorful language and by the romantic tale
he told, the reporters filled the papers with stories of the Virgin of Stamboul for the next several days. The sheikh was filmed in Central Park and
feted by the cream of New York society. Finally "Sari" was found, and the
press reported the reunion between the sheikh and the hysterical girl (an
actress with an exotic look). Soon after, The Virgin of Stamboul opened in
New York. Its story was much like the "real" events reported in the papers.
Was this a coincidence? A quickly made film version of the true story? No

Appendix B: Soft Seduction: How to Sell Anything to the Masses

one seemed to know, but the public was too curious to care, and The Virgin
of Stamboul broke box office records.
A year later Harry was asked to publicize a film called The Forbidden
Woman. It was one of the worst movies he had ever seen. Theater owners
had no interest in showing it. Harry went to work. For eighteen days
straight he ran an ad in all of the major New York newspapers: WATCH THE
SKY ON THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 21ST! IF IT IS GREEN—GO THE CAPITOL IF
IT IS RED—GO THE RIVOLI IF IT IS PINK—GO TO THE STRAND IF IT IS BLUE—
GO TO THE RIALTO FOR ON FEBRUARY 21ST THE SKY WILL TELL YOU WHERE

THE BEST SHOW IN TOWN CAN BE SEEN! (The Capitol, the Rivoli, the

Strand, and the Rialto were the four big first-run movie houses on Broadway.) Almost everyone saw the ad and wondered what this fabulous show
was. The owner of the Capitol asked Harry if he knew anything about it,
and Harry let him in on the secret: it was all a publicity stunt for an unbooked picture. The owner asked to see a screening of The Forbidden
Woman; through most of the film, Harry yakked about the publicity campaign, distracting the man from the dullness onscreen. The theater owner
decided to show the film for a week, and so, on the evening of February 21, as a heavy snowstorm blanketed the city and all eyes turned to the
sky, giant rays of light poured out from the tallest buildings—a brilliant
show of green. An enormous crowd flocked to the Capitol theater. Those
who did not get in kept coming back. Somehow, with a packed house and
an excited crowd, the film did not seem quite so bad.
The following year Harry was asked to publicize a gangster picture
called Outside the Law. On high-ways across the country he set up billboards
that read, in giant letters, IF Y O U D A N C E O N SUNDAY, Y O U A R E O U T S I D E T H E
LAW. On other billboards the word "dance" was replaced by "play golf" or
"play pool" and so on. On a top corner of the billboards was a shield bearing the initials "PD." The public assumed this meant "police department"
(actually, it stood for Priscilla Dean, the star of the movie) and that the
police, backed by religious organizations, were prepared to enforce
decades-old blue laws prohibiting "sinful" activities on a Sunday. Suddenly
a controversy was sparked. Theater owners, golfing associations, and dance
organizations led a countercampaign against the blue laws; they put up their
own billboards, exclaiming that if you did those things on Sunday, you
were not "OUTSIDE THE LAW" and issuing a call for Americans to have some
fun in their lives. For weeks the words "Outside the Law" were everywhere
seen and everywhere on people's lips. In the midst of this the film
opened—on a Sunday—in four New York theaters simultaneously, something that had never happened before. And it ran for months throughout
the country, also on Sundays. It was one of the big hits of the year.

Interpretation. Harry Reichenbach, perhaps the greatest press agent in
movie history, never forgot the lessons he had learned as a barker. The carnival is full of bright lights, color, noise, and the ebb and flow of the

crowd. Such environments have profound effects on people. A clearheaded
person could probably tell that the magic shows are fake, the fierce animals
trained, the dangerous stunts relatively safe. But people want to be entertained; it is one of their greatest needs. Surrounded by color and excitement, they suspend their disbelief for a while and imagine that the magic
and danger are real. They are fascinated by what seems to be both fake and
real at the same time. Harry's publicity stunts merely re-created the carnival
on a larger scale. He pulled people in with the lure of colorful costumes, a
great story, irresistible spectacle. He held their attention with mystery, controversy, whatever it took. Catching a kind of fever, as they would at the
carnival, they flocked without thinking to the films he publicized.
The lines between fiction and reality, news and entertainment are even
more blurred today than in Harry Reichenbach's time. What opportunities
that presents for soft seduction! The media is desperate for events with entertainment value, inherent drama. Feed that need. The public has a weakness for what seems both realistic and slightly fantastical—for real events
with a cinematic edge. Play to that weakness. Stage events the way Bernays
did, events the media can pick up as news. But here you are not starting a
social trend, you are after something more short term: to win people's attention, to create a momentary stir, to lure them into your tent. Make your
events and publicity stunts plausible and somewhat realistic, but make their
colors a little brighter than usual, the characters larger than life, the drama
higher. Provide an edge of sex and danger. You are creating a confluence of
real life and fiction—the essence of any seduction.
It is not enough, however, to win people's attention: you need to hold
it long enough to hook them. This can always be done by sparking controversy, the way Harry liked to stir up debates about morals. While the media
argues about the effect you are having on people's values, it is broadcasting
your name everywhere and inadvertently bestowing upon you the edge
that will make you so attractive to the public.
